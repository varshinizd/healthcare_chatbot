Doctors may use the A1C alone or in combination with other diabetes tests to make a diagnosis. They also use the A1C to see how well you are managing your diabetes. This test is different from the blood sugar checks that people with diabetes do every day.  Your A1C test result is given in percentages. The higher the percentage, the higher your blood sugar levels have been:  A normal A1C level is below 5.7% Prediabetes is between 5.7 to 6.4%. Having prediabetes is a risk factor for getting type 2 diabetes. People with prediabetes may need retests every year. Type 2 diabetes is above 6.5% If you have diabetes, you should have the A1C test at least twice a year. The A1C goal for many people with diabetes is below 7. It may be different for you.

    "summary": "What is acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)? Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a neurologic disease. It is rare, but serious. It affects an area of the spinal cord called gray matter. This can cause the muscles and reflexes in the body to become weak.  Because of these symptoms, some people call AFM a \"polio-like\" illness. But it is different from polio. AFM is not caused by polioviruses.  What causes acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)? AFM can be caused by several different viruses. Researchers think that enteroviruses have been causing the recent increases in the number of children with AFM. AFM can also be caused by other viruses, including flaviviruses, herpesviruses, and adenoviruses.  Most people with AFM had a mild respiratory illness or fever (like you would get from a viral infection) before they got AFM.  Who is more likely to develop acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)? Anyone can get AFM, but most cases (more than 90%) have been in young children.  What are the symptoms of acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)? Most people with AFM will suddenly have: Arm or leg weakness  A loss of muscle tone and reflexes  Some people also have other symptoms, including: Facial drooping/weakness Trouble moving the eyes Drooping eyelids Trouble swallowing Slurred speech Pain in the arms, legs, back, or neck   Sometimes AFM can weaken the muscles that you need for breathing. This can lead to respiratory failure, which is very serious. If you get respiratory failure, you may need to use a ventilator (breathing machine) to help you breathe.  If you or your child develops any of these symptoms, get medical care right away.  How is acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) diagnosed? AFM causes many of the same symptoms as other neurologic diseases, such as transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barre syndrome. This can make it difficult to diagnose. To find out if you have AFM, your doctor may use:  A neurologic exam, including looking at where there is weakness, poor muscle tone, and decreased reflexes An MRI to look at the spinal cord and brain Lab tests on the cerebrospinal fluid (the fluid around the brain and spinal cord) Nerve conduction and electromyography (EMG) studies. These tests check nerve speed and the response of muscles to the messages from the nerves.    It is important that the tests are done as soon as possible after the symptoms start.  What are the treatments for acute flaccid myelitis (AFM)?  There is no specific treatment for AFM. A doctor who specializes in treating brain and spinal cord illnesses (neurologist) may recommend treatments for specific symptoms. For example, physical and/or occupational therapy may help with arm or leg weakness. Researchers do not know the long-term outcomes of people who get AFM.  Can acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) be prevented? There is no specific way to prevent AFM. But you can take steps to prevent getting sick from a virus by:  Washing your hands often with soap and water Avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch, including toys Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or upper shirt sleeve, not hands Staying home when sick   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job: White blood cells help your body fight infection Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding  When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.  What is acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)?  Acute lymphocytic leukemia is a type of acute leukemia. It's also called ALL and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. \"Acute\" means that it usually gets worse quickly if it's not treated. ALL is the most common type of cancer in children. It can also affect adults.  In ALL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. These cells normally help your body fight infection. But in ALL, they are abnormal and cannot fight infection very well. They also crowd out the healthy cells, which can lead to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. These abnormal cells can also spread to other parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord.  What causes acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)? ALL happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown. However, there are certain factors that raise your risk of ALL.  Who is at risk for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)? The factors that raise your risk of ALL include: Being male Being white Being over age 70 Having had chemotherapy or radiation therapy Having been exposed to high levels of radiation Having certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome   What are the symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)? The signs and symptoms of ALL include: Weakness or feeling tired Fever or night sweats Easy bruising or bleeding Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding. Shortness of breath Weight loss or loss of appetite Pain in the bones or stomach Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs Swollen lymph nodes - you may notice them as painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin Having had many infections   How is acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose ALL and figure out which subtype you have: A physical exam A medical history Blood tests, such as                 Complete blood count (CBC) with differential          Blood chemistry tests such as a basic metabolic panel (BMP), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), kidney function tests, liver function tests, and electrolyte panel          Blood smear                   Bone marrow tests. There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing. Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes   If you are diagnosed with ALL, you may have additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and a lumbar puncture, which is a procedure to collect and test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  What are the treatments for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL)? Treatments for ALL include: Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells   Treatment is usually done in two phases: The goal of the first phase is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. This treatment puts the leukemia into remission. Remission means that the signs and symptoms of cancer are reduced or have disappeared.  The second phase is known as post-remission therapy. Its goal is to prevent a relapse (return) of the cancer. It involves killing any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow.   Treatment during both phases also usually includes central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis therapy. This therapy helps prevent the spread of leukemia cells to the brain and spinal cord. It may be high dose chemotherapy or chemotherapy injected into the spinal cord. It also sometimes includes radiation therapy.  NIH: National Cancer Institute",

Adenoids usually start to shrink after about age 5. By the teenage years, they are almost completely gone. By then, the body has other ways to fight germs.   What are enlarged adenoids?   Enlarged adenoids are adenoids that are swollen. It is a common problem in children.   What causes enlarged adenoids?   Your child's adenoids can be enlarged, or swollen, for different reasons. It may just be that your child had enlarged adenoids at birth. Adenoids can also become enlarged when they are trying to fight off an infection. They might stay enlarged even after the infection is gone.   What problems can enlarged adenoids cause?  Enlarged adenoids can make it hard to breathe through the nose.  Your child might end up breathing only through the mouth. This may cause:  A dry mouth, which can also lead to bad breath Cracked lips A runny nose   Other problems that enlarged adenoids can cause include: Loud breathing Snoring Restless sleep Sleep apnea, a disorder that causes you to repeatedly stop breathing during sleep Ear infections   How can enlarged adenoids be diagnosed?  To find out if your child has enlarged adenoids, the health care provider will:  Ask about your child's medical history, including asking about your child's symptoms Check your child's ears, throat, and mouth Feel your child's neck     Since the adenoids are higher up than the throat, the provider cannot see them just by looking through your child's mouth.  To check the size of your child's adenoids, your provider may use: A special mirror in the mouth A long, flexible tube with a light (an endoscope) An x-ray   What are the treatments for enlarged adenoids?  The treatment depends on what is causing the problem. If the symptoms are not too bad, your child may not need treatment. If treatment is needed, your child may get nasal spray to reduce the swelling or antibiotics if the provider thinks that there is a bacterial infection.    In some cases, your child may need an adenoidectomy.  What is an adenoidectomy and why might I my child need one?  An adenoidectomy is surgery to remove the adenoids. The provider may recommend this surgery if: Your child has repeated infections of the adenoids. Sometimes the infections can also cause ear infections and fluid buildup in the middle ear. Taking antibiotics doesn't get rid of a bacterial infection of the adenoids. The enlarged adenoids block the airways.   If there is also a problem with the tonsils, your child will probably have a tonsillectomy (removal of the tonsils) at the same time that the adenoids are removed.  After having the surgery, your child usually goes home the same day. Your child will probably have some throat pain, bad breath, and a runny nose. It can take several days to feel all better.",

All of these hormones do many important jobs, including: Turning food into energy and managing blood sugar levels Balancing salt and water Keeping blood pressure normal Responding to illness and stress (your \"fight or flight\" response) Timing when and how fast a child develops sexually Supporting pregnancy   What are adrenal gland disorders? When you have an adrenal gland disorder, your body makes too much or too little of one or more hormones. The symptoms depend on the type of problem you have and how much it affects the hormone levels in your body. There are many types of adrenal gland disorders, including: Addison's Disease - a condition in which the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol Cushing's Syndrome - a condition caused by too much cortisol in the body, often from taking steroid medicines for a long time Aldosterone-producing adenoma - a benign tumor (not cancer) that makes too much aldosterone and may cause serious high blood pressure Hereditary paraganglioma-pheochromocytoma - an inherited condition causing different types of tumors that make adrenaline and other hormones. Some tumors may become cancerous. Adrenal gland cancer - cancerous tumors, including adrenocortical carcinoma and neuroblastoma Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia (CAH) - a group of inherited disorders in which the adrenal glands don't make enough cortisol. The most common type is 21-hydroxylase deficiency (also called CAH1). In the United States, newborn babies get a blood test to see if they have CAH. People born with CAH may not have symptoms until childhood or later in life.   What causes adrenal gland disorders? The cause of adrenal gland disorders depends on the type of disorder you have. Causes can include: Medicines such as steroids A problem in another gland, such as the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland releases hormones that affect how the adrenal glands work. Changes in genes (mutations). These changes can cause the adrenal glands to make too much or too little of one or more hormones. Infections  In many cases the cause of the problem isn't clear.  How are adrenal gland disorders diagnosed? Health care providers use different tests to check for adrenal disorders depending on your symptoms and health history.  For example, you may have tests of your blood, urine (pee), or saliva (spit).  These tests check your hormone levels. Your provider may order x-rays, CT scans, or MRI scans to look for tumors.  What are the treatments for adrenal gland disorders? Different types of adrenal gland disorders have different treatments. They include medicines and surgery.

Your surgeon can tell you how you might feel and what you will be able to do - or not do - the first few days, weeks, or months after surgery. Some other questions to ask are: How long you will be in the hospital What kind of supplies, equipment, and help you might need when you go home When you can go back to work When it is ok to start exercising again Are there any other restrictions in your activities   Following your surgeon's advice can help you recover as soon as possible.

    "summary": "Many Americans drink alcohol at least occasionally. The  Dietary Guidelines for Americans say that adults of legal drinking age should either not drink or drink in moderation. Drinking less is better for your health than drinking more. Also, there are some people who should not drink at all.  If you are going to drink, it's important to know how alcohol affects you and how much is too much.  How does alcohol affect the body? Alcohol is a central nervous system depressant. This means that it is a drug that slows down brain activity. It can change your mood, behavior, and self-control. It can cause problems with memory and thinking clearly. Alcohol can also affect your coordination and physical control.  Alcohol also has effects on the other organs in your body. For example, it can raise your blood pressure and heart rate. If you drink too much at once, it could make you throw up.   Why are the effects of alcohol different from person to person? Alcohol's effects vary from person to person, depending on a variety of factors, including:  How much you drink How often you drink Your age Your sex Your genetics Your overall health Whether or not you have a family history of alcohol problems   What is moderate drinking?  For most women, moderate drinking is no more than 1 standard drink a day For most men, moderate drinking is no more than 2 standard drinks a day   Even though moderate drinking may be safe for many people, there are still risks. Moderate drinking can raise the risk of death from certain cancers and heart diseases.  What is a standard drink? In the United States, a standard drink is one that contains about 14 grams of pure alcohol, which is found in: 12 ounces of regular beer (5% alcohol content) 5 ounces of wine (12% alcohol content) 1.5 ounces or a \"shot\" of distilled spirits or liquor (40% alcohol content)   Who should not drink alcohol? Some people should not drink alcohol at all, including those who: Are in recovery from an alcohol use disorder (AUD)  Are are unable to control the amount they drink Are under age 21 Are pregnant or trying to become pregnant Are taking medicines that can interact with alcohol Have medical conditions that get can worse if you drink alcohol Are planning on driving Will be operating machinery or doing activities that require skill, coordination, and alertness   If you have questions about whether it is safe for you to drink, talk with your health care provider.  What is excessive drinking? Excessive drinking includes binge drinking and heavy alcohol use: Binge drinking is drinking so much at once that your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 0.08% or more:       For men, this usually happens after having 5 or more drinks within a few hours.   For women, it is usually after about 4 or more drinks within a few hours.      Heavy alcohol use means:      For men, having more than 5 drinks on any day or more than 15 drinks per week.   For women, having more than 4 drinks on any day or more than 8 drinks per week.       Binge drinking raises your risk of injuries, car crashes, and alcohol overdose. It also puts you at risk of becoming violent or being the victim of violence.  Heavy alcohol use over a long period of time may cause health problems such as: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) Liver diseases, including cirrhosis and fatty liver disease Heart diseases Increased risk of certain cancers Increased risk of injuries   Heavy alcohol use can also cause problems at home, at work, and with friends. But treatment can help.   NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism",

    "disease": "Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD)",
    "summary": "What is alcohol use disorder (AUD)? For most adults, moderate alcohol use is probably not harmful. Your risk of developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD) depends on how much, how often, and how quickly you drink alcohol. Alcohol misuse means that drinking causes distress and harm. Over time alcohol misuse can increase your risk of AUD.   AUD can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms. Severe AUD is sometimes called alcoholism or alcohol dependence.    AUD is a disease that causes:  Craving - a strong need to drink Loss of control - not being able to stop drinking once you've started Negative emotional state - feeling anxious and irritable when you are not drinking   What is binge drinking? Binge drinking is a type of alcohol misuse. It means drinking so much at once that your blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level is 0.08% or more. For a man, this usually happens after having 5 or more drinks within a few hours. For a woman, it is after about 4 or more drinks within a few hours. Not everyone who binge drinks has an AUD, but they are at higher risk for getting one.  What are the dangers of too much alcohol? Too much alcohol is dangerous. Heavy drinking can increase the risk of certain cancers. It may lead to liver diseases, such as fatty liver disease and cirrhosis. It can also cause damage to the brain and other organs. Drinking during pregnancy can harm your fetus. Alcohol also increases the risk of death from car crashes, injuries, homicide, and suicide.  How do I know if I have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)? You may have an AUD if you can answer yes to two or more of these questions:  In the past year, have you:   Ended up drinking more or for a longer time than you had planned to? Wanted to cut down or stop drinking, or tried to, but couldn't? Spent a lot of your time drinking or recovering from drinking? Felt a strong need to drink? Found that drinking - or being sick from drinking - often interfered with your family life, job, or school? Kept drinking even though it was causing trouble with your family or friends? Given up or cut back on activities that you enjoyed just so you could drink? Gotten into dangerous situations while drinking or after drinking? Some examples are driving drunk and having unsafe sex. Kept drinking even though it was making you feel depressed or anxious? Or when it was adding to another health problem? Had to drink more and more to feel the effects of the alcohol? Had withdrawal symptoms when the alcohol was wearing off? They include trouble sleeping, shakiness, irritability, anxiety, depression, restlessness, nausea, and sweating. In severe cases, you could have a fever, seizures, or hallucinations.   If you have any of these symptoms, your drinking may already be a cause for concern. The more symptoms you have, the more serious the problem is.   What should I do if I think that I might have an alcohol use disorder (AUD)? If you think you might have an AUD, see your health care provider for an evaluation. Your provider can help make a treatment plan, prescribe medicines, and if needed, give you treatment referrals.

    "summary": "What is an alcohol use disorder?  An alcohol use disorder (AUD) is drinking that causes distress and harm. It is a medical condition in which you: Drink alcohol compulsively Can't control how much you drink Feel anxious, irritable, and/or stressed when you are not drinking   An AUD can range from mild to severe, depending on the symptoms. Severe AUD is sometimes called alcoholism or alcohol dependence.  What are the treatments for alcohol use disorder?  Most people with an alcohol use disorder can benefit from some form of treatment. Medical treatments include medicines and behavioral therapies. For many people, using both types gives them the best results. People who are getting treatment for AUD may also find it helpful to go to a support group such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). If you have an AUD and a mental illness, it is important to get treatment for both.   Some people may need intensive treatment for AUD. They may go to a residential treatment center for rehabilitation (rehab). Treatment there is highly structured. It usually includes several different kinds of behavioral therapies. It may also include medicines for detox (medical treatment for alcohol withdrawal) and/or for treating the AUD.  Which medicines can treat alcohol use disorder?  Three medicines are approved to treat AUD: Disulfiram causes unpleasant symptoms such as nausea and skin flushing whenever you drink alcohol. Knowing that drinking will cause these unpleasant effects may help you stay away from alcohol. Naltrexone blocks the receptors in your brain that make you feel good when you drink alcohol. It can also reduce your craving for alcohol. This can help you cut back on your drinking. Acamprosate helps you avoid alcohol after you have quit drinking. It works on multiple brain systems to reduce your cravings, especially just after you have quit drinking.   Your health care provider can help you figure out if one of these medicines is right for you. They are not addictive, so you don't have to worry about trading one addiction for another. They are not a cure, but they can help you manage AUD. This is just like taking medicines to manage a chronic disease such as asthma or diabetes.  Which behavioral therapies can treat alcohol use disorder?  Another name for behavioral therapies for AUD is alcohol counseling. It involves working with a health care professional to identify and help change the behaviors that lead to your heavy drinking.: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) helps you identify the feelings and situations that can lead to heavy drinking. It teaches you coping skills, including how to manage stress and how to change the thoughts that cause you to want to drink. You may get CBT one-on-one with a therapist or in small groups. Motivational enhancement therapy helps you build and strengthen the motivation to change your drinking behavior. It includes about four sessions over a short period of time. The therapy starts with identifying the pros and cons of seeking treatment. Then you and your therapist work on forming a plan for making changes in your drinking. The next sessions focus on building up your confidence and developing the skills you need to be able to stick to the plan. Marital and family counseling includes spouses and other family members. It can help to repair and improve your family relationships. Studies show that strong family support through family therapy may help you to stay away from drinking. Brief interventions are short, one-on-one or small-group counseling sessions. It includes one to four sessions. The counselor gives you information about your drinking pattern and potential risks. The counselor works with you to set goals and provide ideas that may help you make a change.   Is treatment for alcohol use disorder effective?  For most people, treatment for an AUD is helpful. But overcoming an alcohol use disorder is an ongoing process, and you may relapse (start drinking again). You should look at relapse as a temporary setback, and keep trying. Many people repeatedly try to cut back or quit drinking, have a setback, then try to quit again. Having a relapse does not mean that you cannot recover. If you do relapse, it is important to return to treatment right away, so you can learn more about your relapse triggers and improve your coping skills. This may help you be more successful the next time.  NIH: National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism",

    "summary": "What is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency)? Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency, or AATD) is an inherited condition that raises your risk for lung and liver disease. If you have this condition, your body doesn't make enough alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT).  AAT is made by your liver. It helps protect your lungs from inflammation and irritating substances you might breathe in, such as smoke. If your liver doesn't make enough AAT, your lungs may be more easily damaged from smoking, pollution, or dust from the environment. This can lead to a serious lung condition called chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). AAT deficiency may also cause a liver disease called cirrhosis. This is more common in children who have AAT deficiency.  What causes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency)? AAT deficiency is a genetic disorder. That means it's caused by changes in your genes, which may also be called gene variants or mutations.   Your genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works. AAT deficiency is caused by changes in the SERPINA1 gene, which carries instructions for making the AAT protein. These gene changes are inherited from your parents, so AAT deficiency tends to run in families:  If you have two mutated copies of the gene, it means you have a condition called AAT deficiency. People with this disorder have a higher risk of getting lung disease or liver damage before the age of 45. If you have one mutated copy of the gene, you are a carrier of AAT deficiency. In these cases, this means you are at slightly higher risk of developing lung disease, especially if you have other risk factors, such as being a smoker. You could still pass the mutated gene on to your children.   There are a few gene changes that cause AAT deficiency. These gene changes can:  Decrease the amount of AAT protein your liver makes. Prevent your liver from making any AAT. Affect the shape of the AAT protein so that it can't move out of your liver to protect your lungs. Over time, AAT builds up in your liver and causes damage.   What are the symptoms of alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency)? Some people who have AAT deficiency do not have any symptoms. For those who do, symptoms usually appear in people between 20 and 50 years old. These symptoms may include:  Wheezing Shortness of breath, especially after exercise Chronic cough with phlegm (mucus) Repeated respiratory infections such as colds and the flu Chest pain Fatigue Faster-than-normal heartbeat when you stand up Vision problems Losing weight without trying   Some people who have AAT deficiency may have liver damage. Signs of liver damage include jaundice (a condition that causes your skin and eyes to turn yellow) and swelling in your legs.  Rarely, AAT deficiency can cause skin problems, such as painful lumps or patches.  How is alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency) diagnosed? Your health care provider may test you for AAT deficiency if you have:  Symptoms of AAT deficiency  A condition that could be related to AAT deficiency Relatives who have AAT deficiency Relatives who have a lung or liver disease that could be related to AAT deficiency   AAT deficiency in babies often affects the liver. Your baby may need AAT testing if he or she has signs of liver disease such as jaundice or abnormal liver enzyme tests.  A blood test can check the level of AAT protein in your blood. If the level is lower than normal, it is likely that you have AAT deficiency.  A genetic test is the most certain way to check for AAT deficiency and should be done to confirm the results of the blood test. There are two types of genetic tests:  A genotype test looks for the more common types of gene changes that can cause AAT deficiency. A phenotype test checks for changes in the AAT protein that change how it would normally work.   If your lungs are affected, you may also have lung function tests to see how well your lungs are working.  What are the treatments for alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AAT deficiency)?  There is no cure for AAT deficiency, but there are treatments to help with the symptoms and slow the lung damage it causes. Treatment options may include:  Inhaled medicines to help you breathe better. Pulmonary rehabilitation. Oxygen therapy. Augmentation therapy, which is a lifelong treatment. It raises the levels of the AAT protein in your lungs, using ATT protein taken from the blood of donors. It helps slow down lung damage. It cannot prevent liver damage. Lung surgery or a lung transplant, if your lungs are severely damaged. Liver transplant, if your liver is severely damaged.   To help prevent or delay lung damage, it is important to quit smoking (if you smoke) and avoid secondhand smoke, dust, and air pollution. Ask your provider If you need to stop drinking alcohol.",

You may feel fulfillment from helping someone else. But sometimes caregiving can be stressful and even overwhelming. This can be especially true when caring for someone with Alzheimer's disease (AD).   AD is an illness that changes the brain. It causes people to lose the ability to remember, think, and use good judgment. They also have trouble taking care of themselves. Over time, as the disease gets worse, they will need more and more help. As a caregiver, it is important for you to learn about AD. You will want to know what happens to the person during the different stages of the disease.

As a caregiver for someone with AD, your responsibilities can include: Getting your loved one's health, legal, and financial affairs in order. If possible, include them in the planning while they can still make decisions. Later you will need to take over managing their finances and paying their bills. Evaluating their house and making sure it's safe for their needs Monitoring their ability to drive. You may want to hire a driving specialist who can test their driving skills. When it is no longer safe for your loved one to drive, you need to make sure that they stop.  Encouraging your loved one to get some physical activity.

Dementia is a brain disorder that seriously affects thinking and memory skills. If you have AD, it can impair your ability to reason or learn new skills until it becomes difficult to complete daily activities. AD begins slowly over many years. It first involves the parts of the brain that control thought, memory, and language. It may be mistaken for normal memory changes with aging. However, AD is not a normal part of aging. The brain changes from the disease lead to symptoms that get worse over time.   What are the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease? People with AD may have trouble remembering recent events or the names of people they know. Behavior may vary from person to person and day to day. AD progresses in stages. Late-onset AD occurs in adults aged 65 and older, which is when most people develop the disease. Early-onset AD happens before age 65, which is not common.  Some symptoms of AD can include:  Getting lost in familiar places Repeating the same question  Not recognizing family members Having trouble speaking, reading, or writing Not taking care of yourself, such as not bathing or eating poorly     In AD, over time, symptoms get worse. Later on, people with AD may become anxious or aggressive or wander away from home. Eventually, they need total care. This can cause great stress for family members who must care for them.   Who is more likely to develop Alzheimer's disease? Researchers don't fully understand what causes AD. Age is the biggest risk factor. Your risk is also higher if a family member has had the disease. Although people who develop Alzheimer's don't always have a history of the disease in their families.   Researchers believe the causes of AD may be a combination of age-related changes in the brain, along with genetic, health, and lifestyle factors. Some medical conditions that are associated with a higher risk of AD include:  Hearing loss Depression Mild cognitive impairment Concussion or other traumatic brain injury (TBI)    A related problem, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), causes more memory problems than normal for people of the same age.  Many, but not all, people with MCI will develop AD.    How is Alzheimer's disease diagnosed? Some health conditions can cause memory loss or symptoms like AD. Talk with your health care provider if you're having noticeable changes in your memory. To determine if your symptoms are related to AD and not normal aging or another health condition, your provider may:  Review your medical history and any medicines you're taking Conduct tests to check your memory, thinking, and problem-solving skills Ask about changes in behavior or personality Do tests to rule out any medical or mental health conditions  Refer you to a provider that specializes in caring for older adults  Recommend a neurologist, a doctor who specializes in treating diseases of the brain and nervous system   What are the treatments for Alzheimer's disease? No treatment can stop the disease. However, some medicines may help keep symptoms from getting worse for a limited time.  Can Alzheimer's disease be prevented? You can't change some risk factors, like your age. But changing certain lifestyle factors may promote your brain health and help you live a healthier lifestyle overall.

Causes include: Strabismus - a disorder in which the two eyes don't line up in the same direction Refractive error in an eye - when one eye cannot focus as well as the other, because of a problem with its shape.  This includes nearsightedness, farsightedness, and astigmatism. Cataract - a clouding in the lens of the eye   It can be hard to diagnose amblyopia.  It is often found during a routine vision exam.  Treatment for amblyopia forces the child to use the eye with weaker vision.  There are two common ways to do this.  One is to have the child wear a patch over the good eye for several hours each day, over a number of weeks to months.  The other is with eye drops that temporarily blur vision.  Each day, the child gets a drop of a drug called atropine in the stronger eye.  It is also sometimes necessary to treat the underlying cause.  This could include glasses or surgery.

Who is more likely to develop anal cancer? Anyone can get anal cancer, but you are more likely to develop it if you:  You have an infection with high-risk HPV, especially if you have certain types. Most anal cancers are related to HPV infection. Have a weakened immune system, from conditions such as HIV or because of medicines you need to take after an organ transplant. Have had vulvar, vaginal, or cervical cancer. Have many sexual partners. Have anal sex. Smoke cigarettes.   What are the symptoms of anal cancer? The signs and symptoms of anal cancer may include:  Bleeding from the anus or rectum A lump near the anus Pain or pressure in the area around the anus Itching or discharge from the anus A change in bowel habits, such as narrower stools, having to go more often, or bowel incontinence   How is anal cancer diagnosed? To find out if you have anal cancer, your provider:  Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. Will ask about your family health history. May do a digital rectal examination (DRE). A DRE is an exam of the anus and rectum. For the exam, your provider will insert a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of your rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. May order tests that examine the anus and rectum, such as:       An anoscopy, an exam of the anus and lower rectum using a short, lighted tube called an anoscope. There is also a type of anoscopy called a high-resolution anoscopy. It uses a special magnifying device called a colposcope along with the anoscope to view these areas.   A proctoscopy, a procedure to look inside the rectum and anus using a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens.   An endo-anal or endorectal ultrasound, a procedure in which an ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum.     May do a biopsy during an anoscopy or proctoscopy.   What are the treatments for anal cancer? The treatments for anal cancer include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and surgery. Which treatment you get will depend on how advanced the cancer is, your overall health, and your preferences.  Can anal cancer be prevented? You may be able to lower your risk of getting anal cancer by getting an HPV vaccine and not smoking. Contact your provider if you need help quitting smoking.  It is currently not known if using condoms can prevent anal HPV infections. But using latex condoms every time you have sex can help prevent HIV, a risk factor for anal cancer. And they also help prevent other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.  If you are an adult with HIV, it's important to get an anal cancer screening every year. The screening checks for anything that seems unusual, such as lumps, burning, and precancer cells (cells that could turn into cancer). The screening will include a digital rectal exam. If anything unusual is found, you will have an anoscopy or high resolution anoscopy.",

    "summary": "What is anesthesia? Anesthesia is the use of medicines, called anesthetics, to prevent pain during surgery and other medical procedures. Medicine may be given by injection, inhalation, topical lotion, spray, eye drops, or a skin patch.   Anesthesia can cause a loss of feeling, awareness, or both. Sedation may be used with anesthesia. Unlike full anesthesia, sedation doesn't make you completely unconscious, and recovery is faster. It helps reduce pain, keep you calm, and make you less aware during procedures such as minor surgeries, endoscopies, imaging, or dental work.   Levels of sedation include:  Minimal sedation. You are awake but more relaxed.  Moderate sedation (conscious sedation). You may feel sleepy and not remember much, but you can still respond when spoken to or touched. Deep sedation. You are very drowsy and may respond only to repeated or stronger stimulation.     What is anesthesia used for? Anesthesia may be used for:  Minor procedures, such as filling a tooth.  Childbirth or procedures such as colonoscopies.  Minor and major surgeries.    In some cases, a dentist, nurse, or doctor may give you an anesthetic. In other cases, you may need an anesthesiologist. This is a doctor who specializes in giving anesthesia.  What are the types of anesthesia? There are several different types of anesthesia:  Local anesthesia numbs a small area like a tooth or a cut that needs stitches.  You are awake during local anesthesia. Regional anesthesia numbs a larger area, like an arm, a leg, or everything below the waist. You may be awake during the procedure, or you may be given sedation. It may be used during childbirth, a Cesarean delivery (C-section), or minor surgeries. General anesthesia affects your whole body. It feels like a deep sleep, but you do not feel anything. It is used during major surgeries, such as heart surgery, brain surgery, back surgery, and organ transplants. Monitored sedation makes you relaxed or sleepy. You may be able to talk, depending on the level of sedation, and you probably won't remember the procedure. It may be used for a colonoscopy or dental work.    Your overall health, medical history, the procedure you're having, and other factors will help determine the type of anesthesia you receive.  What are the risks of anesthesia? Anesthesia is generally safe. But there can be risks, especially with general anesthesia, including:  Heart rhythm problem (arrhythmia). Breathing problems. An allergic reaction to the anesthesia. Temporary confusion (delirium), which can last several days in some people over the age of 60, or briefly in children after waking up from anesthesia. Awareness when someone is under general anesthesia. This usually means that the person hears sounds. But sometimes they can feel pain. This is rare.   Talk to your health care provider about the benefits and risks of anesthesia.",

Aneurysms also can happen in arteries in the brain, heart and other parts of the body. If an aneurysm in the brain bursts, it causes a stroke.  Aneurysms can develop and become large before causing any symptoms.  Often doctors can stop aneurysms from bursting if they find and treat them early. They use imaging tests to find aneurysms.

    "disease": "Angioplasty",
    "summary": "What is angioplasty? Angioplasty is a procedure to improve blood flow in coronary arteries that have become narrow or blocked. Your coronary arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. If you have coronary artery disease, a sticky material called plaque builds up in your coronary arteries. Plaque is made of cholesterol, calcium, and other substances in your blood. Over time, it can narrow your arteries or fully block them. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood.  Angioplasty widens the blocked part of your artery so more blood can get through. It is also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).  What conditions does angioplasty treat? Doctors (usually a heart specialist called a cardiologist) use angioplasty to:   Reduce chest pain from blockages in the coronary arteries. This type of pain is called angina. There are different types of angina. Angioplasty treats certain types. Limit damage to the heart during or right after a heart attack. In this case, angioplasty is an emergency treatment.    Angioplasty does not cure coronary artery disease. To help prevent more plaque blockages, you'll need to take any prescribed medicines, eat healthy foods, and get regular exercise.  What happens during angioplasty? Most people have angioplasties in a hospital in a special room called a cardiac catheterization, or cath, lab. You will be awake and lying down. You'll get medicine to help you relax through an intravenous (IV) line. This is a small tube that goes into a vein in your hand or arm.  Angioplasty is done through a blood vessel in your arm, wrist, or groin. Your doctor will:   Make a small opening in that area to insert a thin tube (a catheter) into a blood vessel.  Thread the tube through the vessel to your heart, using x-rays as a guide. Inject contrast dye inside your arteries. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the x-rays.  Replace the first tube with another one that has a small, deflated balloon on the end. Guide the balloon inside the blockage and inflate it to push the plaque flat against the artery wall. This makes the artery wider and improves blood flow. Sometimes put a small, mesh tube into the artery to help keep it open. The tube is called a stent. Some stents have a coating of medicine that helps prevent blood clots from forming.    What happens after an angioplasty? If you had an angioplasty for chest pain, you'll go to a recovery room for a few hours. You may stay in the hospital overnight. Your doctor will probably prescribe medicines to prevent blood clots. Most people can return to their usual activities after a week. If you had an emergency angioplasty for a heart attack, you'll need to stay in the hospital for about a few more days.   Are there any risks from angioplasty?  Angioplasty is very safe, but every invasive procedure comes with risks. You may get a bruise, feel sore, or have some bleeding where the tubes were inserted. More serious problems don't happen very often, but they are possible. They can include serious bleeding, blood clots, and narrowing of the artery again.

It causes inflammation (swelling) between your vertebrae (the bones that make up your spine) and the joints between your spine and pelvis. AS inflammation can cause stiffness and make it difficult to move and bend. Symptoms of AS can range from mild to severe back pain. Over time, AS can fuse (grow together) your vertebrae, limiting movement and causing a hunched posture. In some people, AS can affect other joints or body parts. There is no cure for AS, but early treatment can help manage symptoms, slow down the disease, and help you lead a more productive life.   Who is more likely to get ankylosing spondylitis? Ankylosing spondylitis usually starts before age 45. Early symptoms may begin between the ages of 15 and 30. Your chance of developing AS can also increase if:   You're a man. AS is more common and severe in men. You have a family history. If a member of your family has AS, you're more likely to get the disease.  You have other medical conditions that may increase your risk of getting AS. These include Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, or psoriasis.    What causes ankylosing spondylitis? No one knows what causes ankylosing spondylitis, but the environment and genes likely play a role. Your genes are parts of DNA in your cells that are passed down from your parents. Certain genes may increase your risk of getting the disease, but not everyone with these genes gets AS.  What are the symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis? AS affects people differently. The most common symptom is pain and stiffness in the lower back and/or hips. The pain is usually worse during the night or after sitting for a long time.  Over time, AS may progress to other areas of your spine or body. Symptoms may depend on which areas of your body the disease affects. Some people have symptoms that come and go. Others may have severe, ongoing pain.  Other symptoms of ankylosing spondylitis may include:  Pain, stiffness, and inflammation of the joints. Difficulty taking a deep breath. This could occur if the joints connecting the ribs are affected. Changes in vision. Fatigue. Loss of appetite. Weight loss.  Skin rashes, such as psoriasis. Abdominal (belly) pain and loose stools (poop).    How is ankylosing spondylitis diagnosed? There is no single test for ankylosing spondylitis. To find out if you have AS your health care provider may:   Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms. Ask about your family health history, including relatives who have had AS. Do a physical exam. Order blood tests or imaging studies.    What are the treatments for ankylosing spondylitis? AS has no cure, but treatment may help relieve symptoms, maintain posture, and slow down the disease. Since other parts of your body can be affected by AS, you will likely work with a team of health care professionals for tests, diagnosis, and care.  Treatment usually includes medicine to help relieve symptoms and keep the disease from getting worse, as well as physical therapy to improve mobility. If AS is severe, surgery may be needed.  You can help manage your AS symptoms if you:  Exercise  Monitor your symptoms  Manage your stress  Use assistive devices as needed  Follow a healthy diet  Stop smoking, or don't start    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Disease",

They work by killing the bacteria or making it hard for the bacteria to grow and multiply. When used properly, antibiotics can save lives. But there is a growing problem of antibiotic resistance.  What is antibiotic resistance? Antibiotic resistance happens when bacteria change and can resist the effects of an antibiotic. The bacteria are not killed, and they continue to grow. The infections these bacteria cause are called resistant infections. Resistant infections can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat. In some cases, they can even be deadly.   Antibiotic resistance does not mean that your body is resistant to antibiotics.  There are many different types of resistant infections. They include MRSA and drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). If you get a resistant infection, you might need:  A long hospital stay A long recovery Follow-up visits with health care providers Treatments that are expensive and may have severe side effects   Antibiotic resistance is one type of antimicrobial resistance. There are other types; viruses, fungi, and parasites can also become resistant to medicines.  How do bacteria become resistant to antibiotics? Antibiotic resistance is a natural process that happens over time. To survive, bacteria can develop defense strategies against antibiotics. This happens through genetic changes in the bacteria. These resistant bacteria survive, grow, and spread.  Each time you take antibiotics, there is a risk that the bacteria will become resistant. So it is important to only take antibiotics when you really need them. They won't work on viral infections such as colds and the flu. And you don't need antibiotics for every bacterial infection. For example, you may not need them for some sinus and ear infections.  Who is more likely to develop an antibiotic-resistant infection? Anyone can develop an antibiotic-resistant infection, but certain people may be at higher risk, including those who:  Have a weakened immune system from diseases such as HIV or from taking medicines that affect the immune system Are getting medical care such as surgery and hospital stays Take antibiotics for a long time Are infants, especially if they were born prematurely Are older adults   How can antibiotic resistance be prevented? There will always be some antibiotic resistance, since it happens naturally. But you can help fight against antibiotic resistance by taking these steps:  Don't use antibiotics for viruses. Don't pressure your health care provider to give you an antibiotic if they don't think you need one. When you take antibiotics, follow the directions carefully. Don't share your antibiotics with others. Don't save antibiotics for later or use someone else's prescription. Help prevent the spread of bacterial infections with good hygiene habits.

It can change your thinking, sleeping, and eating. Depression may make some people think about ending their lives. But antidepressants can help many people who have depression. Researchers think antidepressants may help improve the way your brain uses certain chemicals that control mood or stress.   Are antidepressants used for other conditions? A health care provider may prescribe antidepressants for anxiety, chronic pain, or insomnia. Sometimes providers also prescribe antidepressants for other conditions.  What are the different types of antidepressants? There are many types of antidepressants. Each one works differently. Providers usually prescribe newer antidepressants first because they don't cause as many side effects as older types. They also seem to help more kinds of depression and anxiety problems.   Most of the newer antidepressants belong to one of these three groups:    Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  Serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) Atypical antidepressants, which are newer antidepressants that don't fit into the other groups  If these antidepressants don't help, your provider might suggest one of the older antidepressants. The older types include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), tetracyclics, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs).

Some antidepressants may do a better job helping specific symptoms, such as trouble sleeping. What other medicines and supplements do you take? Some antidepressants can cause problems if you take them with certain medicines and herbs.   Did a certain antidepressant work well for a close relative? An antidepressant that helped a parent, brother, or sister could be a good choice for you, too.  Do you have other health conditions? Certain antidepressants can make some other conditions better or worse. Any other conditions that you have will be part of choosing your depression treatment.    Are you pregnant, planning for pregnancy, or breastfeeding?  If so, your provider will help you find a way to treat your depression that's safe for you and your baby.   How long do antidepressants take to work? Antidepressants usually take 4 to 8 weeks to work, so you'll need to be patient. You may notice that some problems, such as sleeping and eating, get better before your mood improves. That's a good sign. You may just need to give the medicine a little more time to do its job.   Sometimes an antidepressant helps at first, but symptoms return while you're still taking it. But there's usually another one you can try. To get more relief from depression, your provider may suggest combining two antidepressants, using another kind of medicine with an antidepressant, or adding talk therapy or other approaches to improve your mental health.    How long will I need to take an antidepressant?  When an antidepressant starts to work, you and your provider can decide how long you need to stay on it. The typical length of treatment is 6 to 12 months, but some people may stay on antidepressants for much longer.   What are the side effects of antidepressants? Not everyone has side effects from antidepressants. But if you do have them, they're usually mild and may get better over time as your body gets used to the new medicine.   The most common side effects from antidepressants include:  Nausea and vomiting Weight gain Diarrhea Sleepiness Sexual problems, such as a lack of desire or ability to have sex  When thinking about side effects, it's important to remember that there are also risks from not treating depression. Your provider can help you think through the pros and cons of all your options. If you have any side effects from antidepressants, your provider may suggest ways to manage them while you wait to see if the antidepressant will work. If the side effects bother you too much, you may need to change antidepressants. But you should never change your dose or stop taking an antidepressant on your own.  If you have serious problems or notice any changes that worry you, such as new or worsening symptoms, unusual changes in your mood, or you start acting differently, call your provider right away.  In some cases, children, teenagers, and young adults under 25 may be more likely to think about hurting or killing themselves when starting antidepressants or when the dose is changed. Get medical help right away if this happens.  What can I do to take antidepressants safely?  Antidepressants are generally safe when you use them correctly:  Tell your provider about everything you take. That includes medicines, herbs, supplements, and over-the-counter medicines you take, such as pain relievers and decongestants. Be honest about recreational drugs and alcohol, too.   Try to get all your medicines from the same pharmacy. That way the pharmacist can warn you and your provider if you take medicines that may cause problems when used together.  Follow all instructions about how to take your medicine.   Talk with your provider if side effects bother you.  Never stop taking antidepressants without your provider's help. Stopping too fast may make depression come back. You could even make your condition worse. To stop antidepressants safely, you need to give your body time to get used to being without the medicine. Your provider can tell you the safest way to go off an antidepressant.   NIH: National Institute of Mental Health",

    "disease": "Anxiety",
    "summary": "What is anxiety? Anxiety is a feeling of fear, dread, and uneasiness. It might cause you to sweat, feel restless and tense, and have a rapid heartbeat.   It can be a normal reaction to stress. For example, you might feel anxious when faced with a difficult problem at work, before taking a test, or before making an important decision. It can help you to cope. The anxiety may give you a boost of energy or help you focus. But for people with anxiety disorders, the fear is not temporary and can be overwhelming.  What are anxiety disorders? Anxiety disorders are conditions in which you have anxiety that does not go away and can get worse over time. The symptoms can interfere with daily activities such as job performance, schoolwork, and relationships.  What are the types of anxiety disorders? There are several types of anxiety disorders, including:  Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). People with GAD worry about ordinary issues such as health, money, work, and family. But their worries are excessive, and they have them almost every day for at least 6 months. Panic disorder. People with panic disorder have panic attacks. These are sudden, repeated periods of intense fear when there is no danger. The attacks come on quickly and can last several minutes or more. Phobias. People with phobias have an intense fear of something that poses little or no actual danger. Their fear may be about spiders, flying, going to crowded places, or being in social situations (known as social anxiety).   What causes anxiety disorders? The cause of anxiety is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, stress, and your environment may play a role.  Who is at risk for anxiety disorders? The risk factors for the different types of anxiety disorders can vary. For example, GAD and phobias are more common in women, but social anxiety affects men and women equally. There are some general risk factors for all types of anxiety disorders, including: Certain personality traits, such as being shy or withdrawn when you are in new situations or meeting new people Traumatic events in early childhood or adulthood Family history of anxiety or other mental disorders Some physical health conditions, such as thyroid problems or arrhythmia   What are the symptoms of anxiety disorders? The different types of anxiety disorders can have different symptoms. But they all have a combination of: Anxious thoughts or beliefs that are hard to control. They make you feel restless and tense and interfere with your daily life. They do not go away and can get worse over time. Physical symptoms, such as a pounding or rapid heartbeat, unexplained aches and pains, dizziness, and shortness of breath Changes in behavior, such as avoiding everyday activities you used to do  Using caffeine, other substances, and certain medicines can make your symptoms worse.   How are anxiety disorders diagnosed? To diagnose anxiety disorders, your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and medical history. You may also have a physical exam and lab tests to make sure that a different health problem is not the cause of your symptoms.  If you don't have another health problem, you will get a psychological evaluation. Your provider may do it, or you may be referred to a mental health professional to get one.   What are the treatments for anxiety disorders? The main treatments for anxiety disorders are psychotherapy (talk therapy), medicines, or both:  Psychotherapy can help you recognize and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. To be effective, it should focus on your specific anxieties and needs. There are many types; some of the types used for anxiety disorders include:      Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which teaches you different ways of thinking and behaving. It can help you change how you react to the things that cause you to feel fear and anxiety. It may include exposure therapy. This therapy focuses on having you confront your fears so that you will be able to do the things that you had been avoiding.   Acceptance and commitment therapy may help with some anxiety disorders. It uses strategies such as mindfulness and goal setting to reduce discomfort and anxiety.      Medicines to treat anxiety disorders include anti-anxiety medicines and certain antidepressants. Some types of medicines may work better for specific types of anxiety disorders. You should work closely with your provider to identify which medicine is best for you. You may need to try more than one medicine before you can find the right one.   Support groups and stress management techniques may also be helpful.  NIH: National Institute of Mental Health",

Some people are at high risk for aneurysms. It is important for them to get screening, because aneurysms can develop and become large before causing any symptoms. Screening is recommended for people between the ages of 65 and 75 if they have a family history, or if they are men who have smoked. Doctors use imaging tests to find aneurysms.

    "disease": "Aphasia",
    "summary": "What is aphasia? Aphasia is a language disorder that makes it hard for you to read, write, and say what you mean to say. Sometimes it makes it hard to understand what other people are saying, too. Aphasia is not a disease. It's a symptom of damage to the parts of the brain that control language.    The signs of aphasia depend on which part of the brain is damaged. There are four main types of aphasia:  Expressive aphasia is when you know what you want to say, but you have trouble saying or writing your thoughts. Receptive aphasia affects your ability to read and understand speech. You can hear what people say or see words on a page, but you have trouble making sense of what they mean.  Global aphasia is the loss of almost all language ability. You can't speak, understand speech, read, or write.  Anomic or amnesia aphasia is when you have trouble using the right words for certain things, people, places or events.   In some cases, aphasia may get better on its own. But it can be a long-term condition. There's no cure, but treatment may help improve language skills.  What causes aphasia? Aphasia happens from damage to one or more parts of the brain involved with language. The damage may be from:  Stroke, which is the most common cause of aphasia Brain tumor Brain infection or inflammation  Brain injury Other brain disorders or neurologic diseases that affect the brain and get worse over time, such as dementia   Who is more likely to develop aphasia? Anyone can have aphasia at any age, but most people with aphasia are middle-aged or older. Most aphasia happens suddenly from a stroke or brain injury. Aphasia from a brain tumor or other brain disorder may develop slowly over time.  How is aphasia diagnosed? If a health care provider sees signs of aphasia, the provider will usually:  Test the person's ability to understand language and speech. This includes asking questions and checking to see if the person can follow simple commands.  Order an imaging scan to see if there's a brain injury and what part of the brain is damaged. Possible tests include:      MRI   CT scan          If imaging shows signs of aphasia, more tests may be needed. These tests measure how much the brain damage has affected the ability to talk, read, write, and understand. In most cases, the tests are done by a speech-language pathologist or speech therapist (a specialist who treats speech and communication disorders).  What are the treatments for aphasia? Some people fully recover from aphasia without treatment. But most people should begin speech-language therapy to treat aphasia as soon as possible.  Treatment may be one-on-one with a speech therapist or in a group. Therapy using a computer may also be helpful.  The specific therapy depends on the type of language loss that a person has. It may include exercises in reading, writing, following directions, and repeating what the therapist says. Therapy may also include learning how to communicate with gestures, pictures, smartphones, or other electronic devices.     Family participation may be an important part of speech therapy. Family members can learn to help with recovery in many ways, such as:  Using simpler language Including the person with aphasia in conversations Repeating or writing down key words to help communicate more clearly   Language abilities may continue to improve over many years. In general, people recover their ability to understand language more fully than their ability to speak.   How much a person recovers depends on many things, including:  What caused the brain injury What part of the brain was hurt How badly and how much of the brain was hurt The age and health of the person   Can aphasia be prevented? You can help prevent aphasia by:  Making heart-healthy lifestyle changes to lower your chance of having:      A stroke   Heart disease   Vascular disease (problems with your blood vessels)    Protecting your brain from injury:      Wearing the right helmet for sports safety, such as when riding a bike   Taking action to prevent falls   Always wearing your seatbelt and driving safely       NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders",

    "summary": "What is an arrhythmia? An arrhythmia is a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. Your heart beats too quickly, too slowly, or with an irregular pattern. Changes in the electrical signals that control your heartbeat cause arrhythmias.   When your heart beats faster than normal, it's called tachycardia.  When your heart beats too slowly, it's called bradycardia.  When the signal to beat comes too early, it's called a premature or extra heartbeat. It may feel like your heart skipped a beat.    There are many types of arrhythmias. Arrhythmias may affect the upper or lower chamber of your heart. The most common type of arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation, which causes an irregular and fast heartbeat.   Some arrhythmias are harmless, such as when your heart rate speeds up during exercise and slows down when you sleep. But if you have a frequent irregular rhythm, it may mean your heart isn't pumping enough blood into your body. Getting treatment and following a heart-healthy lifestyle can help control arrhythmias. It may also help prevent heart damage that can trigger some heart arrhythmias.  What causes an arrhythmia? Many factors can affect your heart's rhythm, such as having had a heart attack, smoking, congenital heart defects, and stress. Other factors that could increase your risk for some types of arrhythmias could include if you:   Have a family history of arrhythmias. Have certain health conditions, which can include heart and blood vessel diseases, lung diseases, kidney diseases, obesity, and sleep apnea. Are an older adult. Have had recent surgery for your heart, lungs, or throat. Take certain medicines for other health conditions.  Use illegal drugs.   If you have risk factors, some situations that make your heart work harder, raise your blood pressure, or cause strong emotional stress may trigger an arrhythmia.   What are the symptoms of an arrhythmia? You may not have any noticeable symptoms of an arrhythmia. Your provider may find an arrhythmia during your routine checkup. Symptoms of an arrhythmia can include:   Fast or slow heartbeat Skipping, fluttering, or pounding heartbeats Chest pain or discomfort Dizziness or fainting Shortness of breath  Sweating Tiredness or weakness   Seek emergency medical care if you have chest pain, shortness of breath, or think you are having a heart attack.  How is an arrhythmia diagnosed?  To find out if you have an arrhythmia, your health care provider may order an electrocardiogram (EKG).  This test records your heart's electrical activity and is the most common for finding an arrhythmia. Your provider may also:  Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms and lifestyle habits. Do a physical exam, which includes checking your heartbeat and pulse. Order blood tests and other heart tests. Check your legs or feet for swelling. Look for signs of other health conditions that could cause an arrythmia, such as thyroid disease.   What are the treatments for an arrhythmia? Treatment may include medicines, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or pacemaker, or sometimes surgery. Your provider may also recommend avoiding activities that may trigger your arrhythmia. The goal of treatment is to restore a normal heart rhythm. If not treated, arrhythmias can damage your heart, brain, and other organs and could be life-threatening.  Can arrhythmias be prevented? To help prevent an arrhythmia, your provider may suggest that you make heart-healthy lifestyle changes and treat health conditions that may cause arrhythmias.

    "summary": "What are arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)? Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are defects in your vascular system.  Your vascular system is your body's network of blood vessels. It includes your:  Arteries, which carry oxygen-rich blood from your heart to your tissues and organs. Veins, which carry the blood and waste products back to your heart. Capillaries, which are tiny blood vessels that connect your small arteries to your small veins.   An AVM is an abnormal tangle of arteries and veins. They are connected to each other, with no capillaries between them. Without the capillaries, the blood flow from the arteries goes directly into the veins at a faster rate than normal. Because of this, the nearby tissue does not get all the oxygen it would normally get. This lack of oxygen can lead to tissue damage and the death of nerve cells and other cells. The fast rate of blood flow can also increase the blood pressure inside the arteries and veins. This can weaken the arteries and veins. A weakened artery or blood vessel could burst or leak blood.  What causes arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)? AVMs are rare. The cause of AVMs is unknown. Most of the time, people are born with them. But sometimes they can appear shortly after birth or later in life.  What are the symptoms of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)? The symptoms of AVM will depend on where the AVM is located. They can happen anywhere in the body, but they are more common in the brain or spinal cord. Most people with brain or spinal cord AVMs have few, if any, major symptoms. But if a weakened blood vessel bursts, it can spill blood into the brain (called a hemorrhage). Severe hemorrhages can cause a stroke and brain damage.  If an AVM is causing symptoms, they can include:  Seizures Headache Pain in the area where the AVM is located Vision problems Muscle weakness Problems with movement and speech Confusion Dizziness Loss of consciousness   How are arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) diagnosed? To find out if you have an AVM, your health care provider:  Will ask about your symptoms and medical history. Will do a physical exam. This may include listening for a bruit. A bruit is whooshing sound caused by the rapid blood flow through the arteries and veins of an AVM.  May order imaging tests, such as a CT scan, MRI, ultrasound, or cerebral angiography. For a cerebral angiography, you are injected with a special dye that helps the blood vessels in your brain show up on x-rays.   What are the treatments for arteriovenous malformations (AVMs)? Treatments for AVMs will depend on factors such as:  Where the AVM is located Its size Your symptoms  Your overall health Your risk of bleeding   The treatment options may include:  Monitoring for any signs that may mean you have an increased risk of hemorrhage. Medicines to help with the symptoms from AVMs. Surgery, which may be done if you have a higher-than-usual risk of bleeding. There are a few different types of surgery for AVMs. In some cases, you may have more than one type. Surgery can be risky, especially when it's done on the brain or spinal cord.

The eggs are then mixed with sperm to make embryos. The embryos are then put back in the parent's body. In vitro fertilization (IVF) is the most common and effective type of ART.  ART procedures sometimes use donor eggs, donor sperm, or previously frozen embryos. It may also involve a surrogate or gestational carrier. A surrogate becomes pregnant with sperm from one partner of the couple. A gestational carrier becomes pregnant with an egg from one partner and sperm from the other partner.  The most common complication of ART is a multiple pregnancy. It can be prevented or minimized by limiting the number of embryos that are put into the parent's body.",

    "summary": "What is asthma?  Asthma is a chronic (long-term) lung disease. It affects your airways, the tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. When you have asthma, your airways can become inflamed and narrowed. This can cause wheezing, coughing, and tightness in your chest. When these symptoms get worse than usual, it is called an asthma attack or flare-up.  What causes asthma? The exact cause of asthma is unknown. Genetics and your environment likely play a role in who gets asthma.   An asthma attack can happen when you are exposed to an asthma trigger. An asthma trigger is something that can set off or worsen your asthma symptoms. Different triggers can cause different types of asthma: Allergic asthma is caused by allergens. Allergens are substances that cause an allergic reaction. They can include \t \tDust mites  \tMold \tPets  \tPollen from grass, trees, and weeds \tWaste from pests such as cockroaches and mice \t  Nonallergic asthma is caused by triggers that are not allergens, such as \t \tBreathing in cold air \tCertain medicines \tHousehold chemicals \tInfections such as colds and the flu \tOutdoor air pollution \tTobacco smoke \t  Occupational asthma is caused by breathing in chemicals or industrial dusts at work Exercise-induced asthma happens during physical exercise, especially when the air is dry   Asthma triggers may be different for each person and can change over time.  Who is at risk for asthma? Asthma affects people of all ages, but it often starts during childhood. Certain factors can raise your risk of having asthma: Being exposed to secondhand smoke when your mother is pregnant with you or when you are a small child Being exposed to certain substances at work, such as chemical irritants or industrial dusts Genetics and family history. You are more likely to have asthma if one of your parents has it, especially if it's your mother.  Race or ethnicity. Black and African Americans and Puerto Ricans are at higher risk of asthma than people of other races or ethnicities. Having other diseases or conditions such as obesity and allergies Often having viral respiratory infections as a young child Sex. In children, asthma is more common in boys. In teens and adults, it is more common in women.   What are the symptoms of asthma? The symptoms of asthma include: Chest tightness Coughing, especially at night or early morning Shortness of breath Wheezing, which causes a whistling sound when you breathe out  These symptoms can range from mild to severe. You may have them every day or only once in a while.   When you are having an asthma attack, your symptoms get much worse. The attacks may come on gradually or suddenly. Sometimes they can be life-threatening. They are more common in people who have severe asthma. If you are having asthma attacks, you may need a change in your treatment.  How is asthma diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose asthma: Physical exam Medical history Lung function tests, including spirometry, to test how well your lungs work Tests to measure how your airways react to specific exposures. During this test, you inhale different concentrations of allergens or medicines that may tighten the muscles in your airways. Spirometry is done before and after the test. Peak expiratory flow (PEF) tests to measure how fast you can blow air out using maximum effort  Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) tests to measure levels of nitric oxide in your breath when you breathe out. High levels of nitric oxide may mean that your lungs are inflamed.  Allergy skin or blood tests, if you have a history of allergies. These tests check which allergens cause a reaction from your immune system.   What are the treatments for asthma? If you have asthma, you will work with your health care provider to create a treatment plan. The plan will include ways to manage your asthma symptoms and prevent asthma attacks. It will include: Strategies to avoid triggers. For example, if tobacco smoke is a trigger for you, you should not smoke or allow other people to smoke in your home or car. Short-term relief medicines,  also called quick-relief medicines. They help prevent symptoms or relieve symptoms during an asthma attack. They include an inhaler to carry with you all the time. It may also include other types of medicines which work quickly to help open your airways. Control medicines.  You take them every day to help prevent symptoms. They work by reducing airway inflammation and preventing narrowing of the airways.   If you have a severe attack and the short-term relief medicines do not work, you will need emergency care.  Your provider may adjust your treatment until asthma symptoms are controlled.   Sometimes asthma is severe and cannot be controlled with other treatments. If you are an adult with uncontrolled asthma, in some cases your provider might suggest bronchial thermoplasty. This is a procedure that uses heat to shrink the smooth muscle in the lungs. Shrinking the muscle reduces your airway's ability to tighten and allows you to breathe more easily. The procedure has some risks, so it's important to discuss them with your provider.",

    "disease": "Atherosclerosis",
    "summary": "What is atherosclerosis?  Atherosclerosis is a condition in which plaque builds up inside your arteries. Plaque is a sticky substance made up of cholesterol, fat, blood cells, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, plaque hardens and causes your arteries to narrow. That limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body.  Some people may confuse atherosclerosis and arteriosclerosis, but they are not the same thing:   Arteriosclerosis is hardening of the arteries, which means that the arteries thicken and become less flexible. It can have several different causes. Atherosclerosis, which develops from plaque buildup, is a common type of arteriosclerosis.   Atherosclerosis can affect most of the arteries in the body. It has different names, based on which arteries are affected:  Coronary artery disease (CAD) is plaque buildup in the arteries of your heart. Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is plaque buildup in the arteries that carry blood away from the heart to other parts of the body. It most often affects the arteries of your legs, but it can also affect the arteries of your arms or pelvis. Carotid artery disease is plaque buildup in the neck arteries. It reduces blood flow to the brain. Renal artery stenosis is plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to your kidneys. Vertebral artery disease is plaque buildup in the arteries that supply blood to the back of your brain.  Mesenteric artery ischemia is plaque buildup in the arteries that supply your intestines with blood.    What causes atherosclerosis? Plaque often starts to build up during childhood and gets worse with age. The exact cause is unknown, but researchers believe that this buildup happens when there is damage to the arteries. This damage may be caused by unhealthy lifestyle habits, medical conditions, and your genes.  Who is more likely to develop atherosclerosis?  You may be more likely to develop atherosclerosis if you:  Have certain medical conditions, including: \t  \t\tHigh blood pressure \t\tHigh blood cholesterol \t\tDiabetes \t\tMetabolic syndrome \t\tInflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis \t  Have a family history of high blood cholesterol Eat a lot of foods high in saturated fats Smoke or chew tobacco Are older - the risk increases after age 45 men and age 55 in women   What are the symptoms of atherosclerosis? In the early stages, atherosclerosis often does not cause any symptoms. You may first notice some symptoms at times when your body needs more oxygen. For example, this could be when you are having physical or emotional stress.  Your symptoms will depend on which arteries are affected and how much blood flow is blocked:  With coronary artery disease, the symptoms may include angina (a type of chest pain), palpitations (racing or pounding heart), and shortness of breath. With carotid artery disease, you may have a bruit. This is a whooshing sound that your health care provider hears when using a stethoscope. You could also have a transient ischemic attack (TIA), sometimes called a mini-stroke. With peripheral artery disease, you may have pain, aching, heaviness, or cramping in the legs when walking or climbing stairs.  With vertebral artery disease, you may have problems with thinking and memory, weakness or numbness on one side of the body or face, and vision trouble. You could also have a transient ischemic attack. With mesenteric artery ischemia, the symptoms can include severe pain after meals, weight loss, and diarrhea.  For men, erectile dysfunction (ED) is an early warning sign that you may be at higher risk for atherosclerosis and its complications. If you have ED, talk with your provider about your risk of plaque buildup.  What other problems can atherosclerosis cause? Atherosclerosis can cause other health problems, or complications. For example, if a plaque bursts, a blood clot may form. The clot could block the artery completely or travel to another part of the body. Other possible complications can vary, depending on which arteries are affected. For example, blockages in different parts of the body can lead to complications such as a heart attack, stroke, vascular dementia, or limb loss.   How is atherosclerosis diagnosed? To find out if you have atherosclerosis, your provider:   Will ask about your medical and family health history Will ask about your lifestyle and risk factors for plaque buildup in the arteries Will do a physical exam, which will include listening to your heart and the blood flow in your arteries Will likely order tests, such as blood tests and heart health tests   What are the treatments for atherosclerosis? If you have atherosclerosis, your provider will work with you to create a treatment plan that works for you. Your plan will depend on which arteries are affected, how much the blood flow is blocked, and what other medical conditions you have. Possible treatments may include:   Heart-healthy lifestyle changes. Medicines to: \t \t\tManage your risk factors. \t\tTreat atherosclerosis or its complications.  \t\tTreat any medical conditions you have that can worsen plaque buildup. \t  Procedures or surgeries to treat diseases or complications that were caused by plaque buildup. The specific type of procedure or surgery will depend on which arteries are affected. Cardiac rehabilitation, if you have had certain complications from atherosclerosis.   Can atherosclerosis be prevented? There are steps you can take to try to prevent atherosclerosis:  Choose heart-healthy foods, such fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Limit foods that are high in saturated fats, salt, and added sugars. Do regular physical activity. But before you start an exercise program, ask your provider what level of physical activity is right for you. Aim for a healthy weight. Limit how much alcohol you drink. Drinking less is better for health than drinking more. Men should limit their intake to 2 drinks or less in a day. Women should drink 1 drink or less per day. Manage stress.  If you smoke, quit smoking. Avoid secondhand smoke. Get enough good-quality sleep.  NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "summary": "What is atrial fibrillation (AFib)? Atrial fibrillation, also known as AFib or AF, is one of the most common types of arrhythmias.  Arrhythmias are problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. They can cause your heart to beat too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way.  If you have AFib, your heart beats irregularly and sometimes much faster than normal. Also, your heart's upper and lower chambers do not work together as they should. When this happens, the lower chambers do not fill completely or pump enough blood to your lungs and body. This can cause symptoms such as dizziness, fatigue, and a pounding heartbeat.  AFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition. It's very important to treat it, since AFib can put you at risk for stroke and other heart conditions.  What causes atrial fibrillation (AFib)? AFib is most often caused by changes to the heart's tissue or the electrical signaling that helps the heartbeat. These changes can happen due to different conditions and factors, such as high blood pressure, coronary artery disease, congenital heart defects, infections, and aging. Sometimes the cause is unknown.  Who is more likely to develop atrial fibrillation (AFib)? Anyone can develop AFib, but there are certain things that raise your risk for it:  Aging. The risk of atrial fibrillation increases as you get older, especially when you are over age 65. Family history and genetics. AFib can run in families. So can heart disease, which raises your risk of AFib.  Some lifestyle choices. Your risk is higher if you drink a lot of alcohol, use certain illegal drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamines, or smoke. Having certain health conditions, such as:      High blood pressure   Diabetes   Heart failure   Heart valve diseases   Obesity   Hyperthyroidism   Chronic kidney disease   COPD and other lung diseases   Sleep apnea     Race. AFib is more common in people with European ancestry. Recent surgery. You may be at risk of atrial fibrillation in the early days and weeks after surgery on your heart, lungs, or esophagus.   What are the symptoms of atrial fibrillation (AFib)? Some people who have AFib don't have any symptoms and don't know they have it. If you do have symptoms, you may only notice them once in a while. Or you may have symptoms that are more frequent. And in some cases, the symptoms might be severe. If you have heart disease, you are more likely to notice your symptoms. And those symptoms could get worse if your heart disease gets worse.  The symptoms of AFib can include:  Extreme fatigue, which is the most common symptom Heart palpitations (the feeling that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, pounding, or beating too hard or too fast) Trouble breathing, especially when lying down or when exercising Chest pain Dizziness or fainting Low blood pressure   What other problems can AFib cause? If AFib is not treated, it can lead to serious health problems (complications) such as:  Stroke Heart failure Blood clots Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) Cognitive impairment and dementia  To help prevent these problems, it's important to contact your health care provider if you are having symptoms. If you do have AFib, the sooner you are diagnosed and treated, the better.  How is atrial fibrillation (AFib) diagnosed? To find out if you have AFib, your provider:  Will ask about your medical history, including your symptoms, lifestyle, and any other health conditions you may have Will ask about your family history, to find out if you have relatives who have or had AFib Will do a physical exam May order blood tests Will likely order heart tests, such as an electrocardiogram (also called an EKG or ECG) and echocardiogram May ask you to wear a heart monitor device that records your heart's electrical activity   What are the treatments for atrial fibrillation (AFib)? The treatments for AFib may include:  Blood thinner medicines that help prevent blood clots from forming. Medicines to control your heart's rhythm and rate. Following heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as:      Following a heart-healthy eating plan that limits saturated fats, salt, and cholesterol. An example is the DASH eating plan.   Limiting or avoiding alcohol, because it can increase your heart rate.   Aiming for a healthy weight.   Getting regular physical activity.   Managing stress.   Quitting smoking.     Procedures such as:      Electrical cardioversion, which restores your heart rhythm using low-energy shocks to your heart.   Catheter ablation, which scars the tissue that is causing the arrhythmia. The scar tissue blocks the abnormal heart signals.     Surgeries such as:      Surgery to put in a pacemaker to help control the arrhythmia.   A Maze procedure, which creates scar tissue in a maze-like pattern in certain parts of the heart.   Left atrial appendage closure, a surgery on a small sac in the muscle wall of your left atrium (the upper left chamber of your heart). It helps prevent blood clots and can reduce your risk of stroke. This surgery is for people who are not able to take blood thinners.       Can atrial fibrillation (AFib) be prevented? There are steps you can take to help lower your risk of atrial fibrillation, such as:  Making heart-healthy lifestyle changes:      Following a heart-healthy eating plan   Limiting or avoiding alcohol   Aiming for a healthy weight   Getting regular physical activity   Managing stress   Not smoking     Avoiding illegal drugs, such as cocaine and methamphetamines Taking antiarrhythmic medicine (medicine to treat arrhythmia) if you are having heart surgery Treating any health conditions that could raise your risk of AFib   NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "disease": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder",
    "summary": "What is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?   ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder. It is usually first diagnosed in childhood and often lasts into adulthood. But some people don't get diagnosed with ADHD until they are adults. ADHD involves:  Having trouble paying attention (inattention) Having trouble controlling impulsive behaviors (impulsivity) Being overly active (hyperactivity)   What are the types of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)?  There are three types of ADHD:  Mostly Inattentive ADHD. People with this type of ADHD have trouble paying attention and are easily distracted. It's hard for them to organize or finish tasks. They may have trouble following instructions or conversations. Mostly Hyperactive-Impulsive ADHD. People with this type of ADHD have symptoms of both hyperactivity and impulsivity:       With hyperactivity, people feel a need to always be moving. They have trouble sitting still and may fidget and/or talk too much.   With impulsivity, people have trouble controlling their actions and words. They tend to act on sudden ideas or feelings without thinking about the possible results. They may interrupt others a lot or have trouble waiting their turn.     Combined ADHD. People with this type of ADHD have a mix of inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. Combined ADHD is the most common type.   It's normal to sometimes have trouble paying attention or sitting still, especially for children. But people with ADHD have more severe symptoms that can sometimes cause serious problems, for example, failing grades for a child or a job loss for an adult. The symptoms are ongoing and may affect family and social life, too.  What causes attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? The exact cause of ADHD is unknown. ADHD probably results from a combination of factors, such as genetics and your environment. Researchers are looking at possible environmental factors that might raise the risk of developing ADHD. These factors include brain injuries, nutrition, and social environments.  What are the symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? The symptoms of ADHD depend on the type of ADHD a person has: People with symptoms of attention problems may often:  Miss details or make careless mistakes in schoolwork, at work, or in other activities Have trouble staying focused on play activities or work tasks Not seem to listen when spoken to directly Find it hard to follow instructions or finish tasks, or may start but get easily sidetracked Have trouble being organized, keeping belongings in order, and managing time Avoid doing tasks that require long periods of mental effort Lose important items, such as books, wallets, keys, eyeglasses, and cellphones Forget about doing daily activities   People with symptoms of hyperactivity-impulsivity may often:  Fidget and squirm while seated  Get up when staying seated is expected, such as at school or work Run around or climb when it's not appropriate (children) or feel restless (teens and adults) Have trouble doing quiet activities Be constantly moving or \"on the go\" Talk much more than is normal Blurt out answers before questions are completed Have trouble waiting for their turn Interrupt others for example during conversations or games   People with combined ADHD show a mix of inattention and hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms   How is attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) diagnosed? There is no single test to diagnose ADHD. One step of the process for diagnosing ADHD  involves having a physical exam, including vision tests, hearing tests (for children and adults), and other tests to rule out other problems with symptoms like ADHD. Other problems with similar symptoms include anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and certain types of learning disabilities.  The process also involves a thorough medical history and family history.  And it usually includes using standardized ADHD symptom checklists, questionnaires, and/or interview questions. These tools have rating scales (scoring systems) that help the provider see if a person's symptoms and history fit a diagnosis of ADHD.  To make a diagnosis of ADHD, the provider needs to have found all of these things:  Several symptoms of ADHD that began before age 12. Several symptoms of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that have lasted for at least 6 months and cause serious problems:      For children up to age 16, there must be at least 6 ongoing symptoms.   For people 17 and older, there must be at least 5 ongoing symptoms.   Symptoms that happen in 2 or more settings, for example, at home and at work or school.   Symptoms that clearly get in the way of functioning well at school, work, and/or in social situations.   Symptoms aren't caused by another mental health disorder.       What are the treatments for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)? Although there is no cure for ADHD, treatments may help reduce symptoms and improve functioning. ADHD is commonly treated with:  Medicines. Psychotherapy (talk therapy), including behavior therapy. Education or training for parents to give them the skills and strategies to help their child. This is especially important for younger children. A combination of these treatments.   Good treatment plans will include close monitoring, follow-ups, and making changes, if needed, along the way.  Having a healthy lifestyle, such as healthy eating and regular exercise, may also help manage symptoms.  For school-aged children, school support is important.

    "summary": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that begins early in childhood and lasts throughout a person's life. It affects how a person acts and interacts with others, communicates, and learns.  It includes what used to be known as Asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorders.  It is called a \"spectrum\" disorder because people with ASD can have a range of symptoms. People with ASD might have problems talking with you, or they might not look you in the eye when you talk to them.  They may also have restricted interests and repetitive behaviors.  They may spend a lot of time putting things in order, or they may say the same sentence again and again. They may often seem to be in their \"own world.\"  At well-child checkups, the health care provider should check your child's development.  If there are signs of ASD, your child will have a comprehensive evaluation.  It may include a team of specialists, doing various tests and evaluations to make a diagnosis.  The causes of ASD are not known.  Research suggests that both genes and environment play important roles.  There is currently no one standard treatment for ASD.  There are many ways to increase your child's ability to grow and learn new skills.  Starting them early can lead to better results.  Treatments include behavior and communication therapies, skills training, and medicines to control symptoms.  NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development",

    "disease": "Autoimmune Diseases",
    "summary": "What are autoimmune diseases? Your immune system protects you from disease and infection by attacking germs that get into your body, such as viruses and bacteria. Your immune system can tell that the germs aren't part of you, so it destroys them. If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks the healthy cells of your organs and tissues by mistake.   There are more than 80 types of autoimmune diseases. They can affect almost any part of your body. For example, alopecia areata is an autoimmune disease of the skin that causes hair loss. Autoimmune hepatitis affects the liver. In type 1 diabetes, the immune system attacks the pancreas.  And in rheumatoid arthritis, the immune system can attack many parts of the body, including the joints, lungs, and eyes.  What causes autoimmune diseases? No one is sure why autoimmune diseases happen. But you can't catch them from other people.   Autoimmune diseases do tend to run in families, which means that certain genes may make some people more likely to develop a problem. Viruses, certain chemicals, and other things in the environment may trigger an autoimmune disease if you already have the genes for it.   Who is at risk for autoimmune diseases? Millions of Americans of all ages have autoimmune diseases. Women develop many types of autoimmune diseases much more often than men. And if you have one autoimmune disease, you are more likely to get another.   What are the symptoms of autoimmune diseases? The symptoms of an autoimmune disease depend on the part of your body that's affected. Many types of autoimmune diseases cause redness, swelling, heat, and pain, which are the signs and symptoms of inflammation.  But other illnesses can cause the same symptoms.    The symptoms of autoimmune diseases can come and go. During a flare-up, your symptoms may get severe for a while. Later on, you may have a remission, which means that your symptoms get better or disappear for a period of time.    How are autoimmune diseases diagnosed? Doctors often have a hard time diagnosing autoimmune diseases. There's usually not a specific test to show whether you have a certain autoimmune disease. And the symptoms can be confusing. That's because many autoimmune diseases have similar symptoms. And some symptoms, such as muscle aches, are common in many other illnesses. So it can take a long time and some visits to different types of doctors to get a diagnosis. To help your doctor find out if an autoimmune disease is causing your symptoms,: Learn about the health conditions in your family history.  What health problems did your grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins have? Write down what you learn and share it with your doctor.  Keep track of your symptoms, including how long they last and what makes them better or worse. Share your notes with your doctor.  See a specialist who deals with the symptoms that bother you most. For example, if you have rash, see a dermatologist (skin doctor).   What are the treatments for autoimmune diseases? The treatment depends on the disease. In most cases, the goal of treatment is to suppress (slow down) your immune system, and ease swelling, redness, and pain from inflammation. Your doctor may give you corticosteroids or other medicines to help you feel better. For some diseases, you may need treatment for the rest of your life.",

They can be found almost everywhere on Earth. There are lots of bacteria in and on your body. In fact, your body has about 10 times more bacteria cells than human cells.    There are many different types of bacteria. Most types don't make you sick. Some types are helpful. For example, \"good\" bacteria in your digestive system can help your body digest food and absorb vitamins and minerals. They can help protect you from getting sick. Bacteria are also used in making foods like yogurt and cheese.  But some types of bacteria can cause an infection and make you sick. They are called infectious bacteria. These bacteria can reproduce quickly in your body. Many of them give off toxins (poisons) that can damage your cells and make you sick. Other types can move into and damage your tissues. A few examples of bacteria that cause infections include Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and E. coli.  How do bacterial infections spread? There are different ways that bacterial infections may spread:  Through droplets and particles that are breathed out by someone who has the infection. You might breathe in the droplets or particles, or they could land on your mouth, nose, or eyes.  By touching surfaces or objects that have the bacteria on them and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes. Through cuts, scrapes, and skin-to-skin contact with someone who has the infection. From the pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy. Through contaminated food or water. By being bitten by an infected insect or animal. Through sexual contact (usually vaginal, anal and oral sex) with someone who has the infection.   What are the treatments for bacterial infections? Sometimes your immune system may be able to fight off a bacterial infection. But when you do need treatment, it will be with antibiotics.  When you take antibiotics, follow the directions carefully. Each time you take them, there is a risk that the bacteria will become resistant to the effects of the antibiotics. This is called antibiotic resistance. When this happens, the bacteria are not killed, and they continue to grow. They can cause resistant infections, which can be difficult, and sometimes impossible, to treat.    Can bacterial infections be prevented? You can help prevent some bacterial infections by:  Getting vaccines that protect against bacterial infections. Having good hygiene habits. These include washing your hands often and covering your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing. Paying attention to food safety. Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that your frequently touch. Preventing insect bites by using a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent. when you go outdoors. If you travel to an area that has a high risk of diseases from insect bites, also wear long pants, shirts, and socks. Practicing safe sex. This means using a latex condom every time you have anal, vaginal, or oral sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.

But if you are like many people, you are busy, you sit most of the day at your job, and you haven't yet changed your exercise habits. The good news is that it's never too late to start. You can start slowly and find ways to fit more physical activity into your life. To get the most benefit, you should try to get the recommended amount of physical activity for your age. If you can do that, the payoff is that you will feel better, may help prevent or control many diseases, and will likely even live longer.  What are the health benefits of exercise?  Regular exercise and physical activity may:  Help you get to and stay at a healthy weight. Along with diet, exercise plays an important role in maintaining a healthy weight and preventing obesity. If you are at a healthy weight, you can maintain it if the calories you eat and drink are equal to the amount of energy you burn. To lose weight, you need to use more calories than you eat and drink.  Reduce your risk of heart diseases. Exercise strengthens your heart and improves your circulation. The increased blood flow raises the oxygen levels in your body. This helps lower your risk of heart diseases such as coronary artery disease and heart attack. Regular exercise can also lower high blood pressure, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, all of which are risk factors for heart disease.  Help your body manage blood glucose (blood sugar) and insulin levels. Exercise can lower your blood glucose levels and help your insulin work better. This can reduce your risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. And if you already have one of these diseases, exercise can help you manage it.  Help you manage a chronic health condition. For example, regular physical activity may help reduce pain and improve function in adults with arthritis. It can also help support daily living activities for people with disabilities. This may help them be more independent.   Help you quit smoking. Exercise may make it easier to quit smoking by reducing your cravings and withdrawal symptoms. It can also help limit the weight you might gain when you stop smoking.  Improve your mental health and mood. During exercise, your body releases chemicals that can improve your mood and make you feel more relaxed. This can help you deal with stress, manage anxiety, and reduce your risk of depression.  Help keep your thinking, learning, and judgment skills sharp as you age. Exercise stimulates your body to release proteins and other chemicals that improve the structure and function of your brain.  Strengthen your bones and muscles. Regular exercise can help kids and teens build strong bones. Later in life, it can also slow the loss of bone density that comes with age. Doing muscle-strengthening activities can help you increase or maintain your muscle mass and strength. For older adults, this can mean staying independent, like being able to get in and out of a chair or bed without help.    Reduce your risk of some cancers, including colon, breast, uterine, bladder, esophageal, kidney, stomach, and lung cancer. There are different ways that physical activity may lower the risk of these cancers. For example, it can strengthen your immune system and reduce inflammation in your body. It also helps prevent obesity, which is a risk factor for many cancers.   Reduce your risk of falls. For older adults, doing balance and muscle-strengthening activities can help reduce your risk of falling.  Improve your sleep. Exercise can help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer.  Boost your energy. Exercise helps your heart and lungs work better, which can leave you feeling more energetic throughout the day.   Improve your sexual health. Regular exercise may lower the risk of erectile dysfunction (ED) in men. For those who already have ED, exercise may help improve their sexual function. In women, exercise may increase sexual arousal.  Increase your chances of living longer. Studies show that physical activity can reduce your risk of dying early from the leading causes of death, like heart disease and certain cancers.    How can I make exercise a part of my regular routine?  Here are some tips to help you make exercise part of your daily routine:   Make everyday activities more active. Even small changes can help. You can take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk down the hall to a coworker's office instead of sending an email. Wash the car yourself. Park further away from your destination.  Be active with friends and family. Having a workout partner may make you more likely to enjoy exercise. You can also plan social activities that involve exercise. Consider joining an exercise group or class, such as a dance class, hiking club, or volleyball team.  Keep track of your progress. Keeping a log of your activity or using a fitness tracker may help you set goals and stay motivated.  Make exercise more fun. Try listening to music or watching TV while you exercise. Also, mix things up a little bit - if you stick with just one type of exercise, you might get bored. Try doing a combination of activities.  Find activities that you can do even when the weather is bad. You can walk in a mall, climb stairs, or work out in a gym even if the weather stops you from exercising outside.  Remember that some physical activity is better than none.  Do what you can! Even 5 minutes of physical activity has real health benefits.",

    "disease": "Bipolar Disorder",
    "summary": "What is bipolar disorder?  Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder that can cause intense mood swings:  Sometimes you may feel extremely \"up,\" elated, irritable, or energized. This is called a manic episode.  Other times you may feel \"down,\" sad, indifferent, or hopeless. This is called a depressive episode. You may have both manic and depressive symptoms together. This is called a mixed episode.  Along with mood swings, bipolar disorder causes changes in behavior, energy levels, and activity levels.   Bipolar disorder used to be called other names, including manic depression and manic-depressive disorder.  What are the types of bipolar disorder? There are three main types of bipolar disorder:      Bipolar I disorder involves manic episodes that last at least 7 days or manic symptoms so severe that you need immediate hospital care. Depressive episodes are also common. Those often last at least two weeks. This type of bipolar disorder can also involve mixed episodes.  Bipolar II disorder involves depressive episodes. But instead of full-blown manic episodes, there are episodes of hypomania. Hypomania is a less severe version of mania. Cyclothymic disorder, or cyclothymia, also involves hypomanic and depressive symptoms. But they are not as intense or as long-lasting as hypomanic or depressive episodes. The symptoms usually last for at least two years in adults and for one year in children and teenagers.  With any of these types, having four or more episodes of mania or depression in a year is called \"rapid cycling.\"  What causes bipolar disorder? The exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown. Several factors likely play a role in the disorder. They include genetics, brain structure and function, and your environment.  Who is at risk for bipolar disorder? You are at higher risk for bipolar disorder if you have a close relative who has it. Going through trauma or stressful life events may raise this risk even more.  What are the symptoms of bipolar disorder? The symptoms of bipolar disorder can vary. But they involve mood swings known as mood episodes:      The symptoms of a manic episode can include                  Feeling very up, high, or elated         Feeling jumpy or wired, more active than usual         Having a very short temper or seeming extremely irritable         Having racing thoughts and talking very fast         Needing less sleep         Feeling like you are unusually important, talented, or powerful         Do risky things that show poor judgment, such as eating and drinking too much, spending or giving away a lot of money, or having reckless sex            The symptoms of a depressive episode can include              Feeling very sad, hopeless, or worthless         Feeling lonely or isolating yourself from others         Talking very slowly, feeling like you have nothing to say, or forgetting a lot         Having little energy         Sleeping too much         Eating too much or too little         Lack of interest in your usual activities and being unable to do even simple things         Thinking about death or suicide       The symptoms of a mixed episode include both manic and depressive symptoms together. For example, you may feel very sad, empty, or hopeless, while at the same time feeling extremely energized.  Some people with bipolar disorder may have milder symptoms. For example, you may have hypomania instead of mania. With hypomania, you may feel very good and find that you can get a lot done. You may not feel like anything is wrong. But your family and friends may notice your mood swings and changes in activity levels. They may realize that your behavior is unusual for you. After the hypomania, you might have severe depression.  Your mood episodes may last a week or two or sometimes longer. During an episode, symptoms usually occur every day for most of the day.   How is bipolar disorder diagnosed? To diagnose bipolar disorder, your health care provider may use many tools:  A physical exam A medical history, which will include asking about your symptoms, lifetime history, experiences, and family history Medical tests to rule out other conditions A mental health evaluation. Your provider may do the evaluation or may refer you to a mental health specialist to get one.   What are the treatments for bipolar disorder? Treatment can help many people, including those with the most severe forms of bipolar disorder. The main treatments for bipolar disorder include medicines, psychotherapy, or both:      Medicines can help control the symptoms of bipolar disorder. You may need to try several different medicines to find which one works best for you. Some people need to take more than one medicine. It's important to take your medicine consistently. Don't stop taking it without first talking with your provider.  Contact your provider if you have any concerns about side effects from the medicines. Psychotherapy (talk therapy) can help you recognize and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. It can give you and your family support, education, skills, and coping strategies. There are several different types of psychotherapy that may help with bipolar disorder. Other treatment options include:               Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a brain stimulation procedure that can help relieve symptoms. It uses a mild electric current and is done while you are under general anesthesia. ECT is most often used for severe bipolar disorder that is not getting better with other treatments. It may also be used when someone needs a treatment that will work more quickly than medicines. This might be when a person has a high risk of suicide or is catatonic (unresponsive).    Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), a brain stimulation procedure that uses magnetic waves to relieve depression. It is not as powerful as ECT, but with rTMS, you don't need general anesthesia. It also has a low risk of negative effects on your memory and thinking.   Light therapy has been shown to be effective for seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Many people with bipolar disorder also find that their depression gets worse during certain seasons, usually in the fall and winter. Light therapy may help with their symptoms.   Healthy lifestyle changes, such as getting regular exercise, having a consistent sleep schedule, and keeping a mood journal, can also help with your symptoms.           Bipolar disorder is a lifelong illness. But long-term, ongoing treatment can help manage your symptoms and enable you to live a healthy, successful life.   NIH: National Institute of Mental Health",

    "disease": "Bird Flu",
    "summary": "What is bird flu? Birds, just like people, can get the flu. Another name for bird flu is avian influenza. The viruses that cause bird flu normally only infect birds, including chickens, other poultry, and wild birds such as ducks. But sometimes the viruses can infect other animals and, in rare cases, people.   A few types of these viruses have caused most of the infections in people. They are the H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6 viruses. These infections in people have mainly been in Asia, Africa, Europe, the Pacific, and the Near East. Although it's very rare, there have also been some infections in people in the United States.  How do you get bird flu?   The most common ways you can get bird flu are from:  Touching your eyes, nose, or mouth after handling infected live or dead birds Touching surfaces or handling items contaminated by bird flu viruses and then touching your eyes, nose, or mouth Breathing in droplets or dust contaminated with the virus   It's also possible (but very rare) to get bird flu from:  Another type of animal who has bird flu. Bird flu can also infect many other animals, including some dogs, cats, certain wild and zoo animals, and livestock such as cattle. These animals can then spread the flu to people. Another person. Eating poultry, eggs, and beef that were not properly handled and cooked. Drinking raw milk.   Who is more likely to get bird flu? Certain people may be more likely to get bird flu, including:  Poultry workers Animal handlers Wildlife biologists Disease control workers Research laboratory workers Veterinarians People who travel to countries where bird flu is present   What are the symptoms of bird flu in humans? Sometimes bird flu doesn't cause any symptoms. But if you do feel sick, your symptoms can range from mild to severe. Often, the symptoms are similar to the (seasonal) flu, such as:    Fever (but not everyone has a fever) Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Fatigue Headaches Eye redness (conjunctivitis) Trouble breathing  Diarrhea   People with severe illness from bird flu may have pneumonia and might need to be hospitalized.  How is bird flu diagnosed? Laboratory testing is used to diagnose bird flu. It's usually done with a nasal or throat swab. This testing is more accurate when the swab is collected during the first few days of illness.  For people who are severely ill, health care providers may do testing of a different sample, such as fluid taken during a bronchoalveolar lavage or other procedure.  What are the treatments for bird flu? Bird flu is treated with antiviral medicines. It's important to get them as soon as possible. The medicines may make your illness less severe.   You may also be given antiviral medicines if you were exposed to a person or animal who has the virus. This may help prevent you from getting sick.  Can bird flu be prevented?  There is currently no vaccine available to the public. The government has developed a virus that is similar to some H5N1 viruses. The virus could be used to produce a vaccine for people, if needed.  It's important to take precautions to prevent bird flu:  If you have a job or pastime that puts you in contact with birds or other animals, make sure to use proper protective equipment.  Otherwise try to avoid direct contact with wild birds and other animals. Wash your hands with soap and water after touching birds or other animals. Since it's possible to get bird flu through some foods, make sure to handle and cook your food safely and avoid raw milk.    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

    "summary": "What is birth control? Birth control, also known as contraception, is the use of medicines, devices, or surgery to prevent pregnancy. There are many different types. Some are reversible, while others are permanent. Some types can also help prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs).  What are the different types of birth control? There are several different types of birth control, and they work in different ways:    \t \t\t \t\t\tBarrier methods \t\t \t \t \t\t \t\t\tMale condom \t\t\tA thin sheath that covers the penis to collect sperm and prevent it from entering the woman's body. Condoms that are made of latex and polyurethane can help prevent STIs. \t\t \t\t \t\t\tFemale condom \t\t\tA thin, flexible plastic pouch. Part of the condom is inserted into the vagina before intercourse to prevent sperm from entering the uterus. The uterus, or womb, is the place where the baby grows during pregnancy. Female condoms can also help prevent STIs. \t\t \t\t \t\t\tContraceptive sponge \t\t\tA small sponge that you put into the vagina to cover the cervix (the opening of the uterus). The sponge also contains a spermicide to kill sperm. \t\t \t\t \t\t\tSpermicide \t\t\tA substance that can kill sperm cells. It comes in a foam, jelly, cream, suppository, or film. You put it into the vagina near the uterus. Spermicide can be used alone or with a diaphragm or cervical cap. \t\t \t\t \t\t\tDiaphragm and cervical cap \t\t\tCups that are placed inside the vagina to cover the cervix. They may be used with spermicide. They come in different sizes, so it's important to see your health care provider to figure out which size works best for you. \t\t \t \t \t\t \t\t\tHormonal methods \t\t \t \t \t\t \t\t\tOral contraceptives (\"the pill\") \t\t\tPills that a woman takes every day. They may contain only progestin or both progestin and estrogen. \t\t \t\t \t\t\tContraceptive patch \t\t\tA patch that a woman puts on her skin each week. The patch releases hormones into the bloodstream. \t\t \t\t \t\t\tVaginal ring \t\t\tA thin, flexible ring. The woman inserts the ring into the vagina, where it continually releases hormones for three weeks. She takes it out for the fourth week. After that week, she puts in a new ring. \t\t \t\t \t\t\tInjectable birth control \t\t\tAn injection of a hormone that a woman gets once every three months. This is done in your provider's office. \t\t \t\t \t\t\tImplant \t\t\tA single, thin rod that a provider inserts under the skin of a women's upper arm.  It is done in your provider's office. The implant can last for four years. \t\t \t \t \t\t \t\t\tLong-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) \t\t \t \t \t\t \t\t\tIntrauterine device (IUD) \t\t\tA small, T-shaped device that a provider inserts into the uterus. This is done in the provider's office. IUDs can last from 3 to 10 years. There are two types: hormonal IUDs and copper IUDs. \t\t \t \t \t\t \t\t\tSterilization \t\t \t \t \t\t \t\t\tTubal ligation \t\t\tA surgery that prevents a woman from getting pregnant. It is permanent. \t\t \t\t \t\t\tVasectomy \t\t\tA surgery that prevents a man from getting someone pregnant. It is permanent. \t\t \t    What are some other forms of pregnancy prevention?  There are some types of pregnancy prevention that do not involve medicines, devices, or surgery:    \t\t \t\t\tOther forms of pregnancy prevention \t\t \t \t\t \t\t\tFertility awareness-based methods \t\t\tThey are also called natural rhythm methods. They involve tracking the woman's fertility cycle and avoiding sex or using barrier methods on the days when she is most likely to get pregnant. This method may have higher pregnancy rates than other types. \t\t \t\t \t\t\tLactational amenorrhea method (LAM) \t\t\tA form of natural birth control for breastfeeding mothers. It relies on the new mother feeding her baby only breastmilk for up to six months and having no periods or spotting during that time. \t\t  \t\t\tWithdrawal \t\t\tDuring intercourse, the penis is pulled out of the vagina before ejaculation. The goal is to keep sperm from entering the vagina . But the sperm can leak out before the penis is pulled out, so this method has higher pregnancy rates than other types. \t\t \t     What is emergency contraception? Emergency contraception is not a regular method of birth control. But it can be used to prevent pregnancy after unprotected intercourse or if a condom breaks. There are two types: Copper IUD, which is a small, T-shaped device that a provider inserts within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse.  Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs), which are hormonal pills which the woman takes as soon as possible after unprotected intercourse. What else should I know about birth control?When deciding which birth control type is right for you, there are many different factors to consider: Do you want to have children someday? How soon? Do you have any health conditions? How often do you have sex? How many sex partners do you have? Do you also need protection from HIV and other STIs? How well does the birth control method work? Are there any side effects? Will you be able to use it correctly every time? How much does it cost?

    "disease": "Birth Defects",
    "summary": "What are birth defects? A birth defect is a problem that happens while a baby is developing in the mother's body.  Most birth defects happen during the first 3 months of pregnancy. One out of every 33 babies in the United States is born with a birth defect.  A birth defect may affect how the body looks, works, or both. Some birth defects like cleft lip or neural tube defects are structural problems that can be easy to see. Others, like heart disease, are found using special tests. Birth defects can range from mild to severe. How a birth defect affects a child's life depends mostly on which organ or body part is involved and how severe the defect is.  What causes birth defects? For some birth defects, researchers know the cause. But for many birth defects, the exact cause is unknown. Researchers think that most birth defects are caused by a complex mix of factors, which can include: Genetics. One or more genes might have a change or mutation that prevents them from working properly. For example, this happens in Fragile X syndrome. With some defects, a gene or part of the gene might be missing.  Chromosomal problems. In some cases, a chromosome or part of a chromosome might be missing. This is what happens in Turner syndrome. In other cases, such as with Down syndrome, the child has an extra chromosome.   Exposures to medicines, chemicals, or other toxic substances. For example, alcohol misuse can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders.   Infections during pregnancy. For example, infection with Zika virus during pregnancy can cause a serious defect in the brain.  Lack of certain nutrients. Not getting enough folic acid before and during pregnancy is a key factor in causing neural tube defects.    Who is at risk of having a baby with birth defects? Certain factors may increase the chances of having a baby with a birth defect, such as: Smoking, drinking alcohol, or taking certain \"street\" drugs during pregnancy Having certain medical conditions, such as obesity or uncontrolled diabetes, before and during pregnancy Taking certain medicines Having someone in your family with a birth defect. To learn more about your risk of having a baby with a birth defect, you can talk with a genetic counselor, Being an older mother, typically over the age of 34 years   How are birth defects diagnosed? Health care providers can diagnose some birth defects during pregnancy, using prenatal testing.  That's why it important to get regular prenatal care.   Other birth defects may not be found until after the baby is born. Providers may find them through newborn screening. Some defects, such as club foot, are obvious right away. Other times, the health care provider may not discover a defect until later in life, when the child has symptoms.   What are the treatments for birth defects? Children with birth defects often need special care and treatments. Because the symptoms and problems caused by birth defects vary, the treatments also vary. Possible treatments may include surgery, medicines, assistive devices, physical therapy, and speech therapy.   Often, children with birth defects need a variety of services and may need to see several specialists. The primary health care provider can coordinate the special care that the child needs.  Can birth defects be prevented? Not all birth defects can be prevented. But there are things you can do before and during pregnancy to increase your chance of having a healthy baby: Start prenatal care as soon as you think you might be pregnant, and see your health care provider regularly during pregnancy Get 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day. If possible, you should start taking it at least one month before you get pregnant. Don't drink alcohol, smoke, or use \"street\" drugs Talk to your health care provider about any medicines you are taking or thinking about taking. This includes prescription and over-the-counter medicines, as well as dietary or herbal supplements.

    "summary": "Your blood is made up of liquid and solids. The liquid part, called plasma, is made of water, salts, and protein. Over half of your blood is plasma. The solid part of your blood contains red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.  Red blood cells (RBC) deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs. White blood cells (WBC) fight infection and are part of your immune system. Platelets help blood to clot when you have a cut or wound. Bone marrow, the spongy material inside your bones, makes new blood cells. Blood cells constantly die and your body makes new ones. Red blood cells live about 120 days, and platelets live about 6 days. Some white blood cells live less than a day, but others live much longer.  There are four blood types: A, B, AB, or O. Also, blood is either Rh-positive or Rh-negative. So if you have type A blood, it's either A positive or A negative. Which type you are is important if you need a blood transfusion. And your Rh factor could be important if you become pregnant - an incompatibility between your type and the baby's could create problems.   Blood tests such as blood count tests help doctors check for certain diseases and conditions. They also help check the function of your organs and show how well treatments are working.

    "disease": "Blood Clots",
    "summary": "What is a blood clot? A blood clot is a mass of blood that forms when platelets, proteins, and cells in the blood stick together. When you get hurt, your body forms a blood clot to stop the bleeding.  After the bleeding stops and healing takes place, your body usually breaks down and removes the blood clot. But sometimes the blood clots form where they shouldn't, your body makes too many blood clots or abnormal blood clots, or the blood clots don't break down like they should. These blood clots can be dangerous and may cause other health problems. Blood clots can form in, or travel to, the blood vessels in the limbs, lungs, brain, heart, and kidneys. The types of problems blood clots can cause will depend on where they are:     Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot in a deep vein, usually in the lower leg, thigh, or pelvis. It can block a vein and cause damage to your leg. A pulmonary embolism (PE) can happen when a DVT breaks off and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. A PE, especially if it is large, can damage your lungs and prevent your other organs from getting enough oxygen. Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) is a rare blood clot in the venous sinuses in your brain. Normally the venous sinuses drain blood from your brain. CVST blocks the blood from draining and can cause a hemorrhagic stroke. Blood clots in other parts of the body can cause problems such as an ischemic stroke, a heart attack, kidney problems, kidney failure, and pregnancy-related problems.   Who is more likely to develop blood clots? Certain factors can raise your risk of developing blood clots:     Atherosclerosis Atrial fibrillation Being overweight or having obesity Cancer and cancer treatments Certain genetic disorders Certain surgeries COVID-19 Diabetes Family history of blood clots Overweight and obesity Pregnancy and giving birth Serious injuries Some medicines, including birth control pills Smoking Staying in one position for a long time, such as being in the hospital or taking a long car or plane ride       What are the symptoms of blood clots? The symptoms for blood clots can be different, depending on where the blood clot is:     In the abdomen: Abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting In an arm or leg: Sudden or gradual pain, swelling, tenderness, and warmth In the lungs: Shortness of breath, pain with deep breathing, rapid breathing, and increased heart rate In the brain: Trouble speaking, vision problems, seizures, weakness on one side of the body, and sudden severe headache In the heart: Chest pain, sweating, shortness of breath, and pain in the left arm       How are blood clots diagnosed? To find out if you have one or more blood clots, your health care provider:      Will do a physical exam. Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. May order blood tests, including a D-dimer test. May order imaging tests, such as              Ultrasound.         X-rays of the veins (venography) or blood vessels (angiography) that are taken after you get an injection of special dye. The dye shows up on the x-ray and allows the provider to see how the blood flows.         CT Scan.                     What are the treatments for blood clots? Treatments for blood clots depend on where the blood clot is located and how severe it is. Treatments may include:     Blood thinners. Other medicines, including thrombolytics. Thrombolytics are medicines that dissolve blood clots. They are usually used where the blood clots are severe. Surgery and other procedures to remove the blood clots       Can blood clots be prevented? You may be able to help prevent blood clots by:     Moving around as soon as possible after having been confined to your bed, such as after surgery, illness, or injury Getting up and moving around every few hours when you have to sit for long periods of time, for example if you are on a long flight or car trip Wearing compression stockings after surgery or during a long flight Regular physical activity Not smoking Staying at a healthy weight  Some people at high risk may need to take blood thinners to prevent blood clots.",

    "disease": "Blood Glucose",
    "summary": "What is blood glucose? Blood glucose, or blood sugar, is the main sugar found in your blood. It is your body's primary source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy.  What is diabetes? Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose levels are too high. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause serious health problems (diabetes complications). So if you have diabetes, it's important to keep your blood glucose levels within your target range.  What are blood glucose targets? If you have diabetes, your blood glucose target is the range you try to reach as much as possible. The typical targets are:  Before a meal: 80 to 130 mg/dL Two hours after the start of a meal: Less than 180 mg/dL   Your blood glucose targets may be different, depending on your age, any additional health problems you have, and other factors. Talk with your health care team  about the best target range for you.  When and how should I check my blood glucose? If you have diabetes, you'll likely need to check your blood glucose every day to make sure that your blood glucose numbers are in your target range. Some people may need to check their blood glucose several times a day. Ask your health care team how often you need to check it.  The most common way to check your blood glucose level at home is with a blood glucose meter. A blood glucose meter measures the amount of glucose in a small sample of blood, usually from your fingertip.   Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) is another way to check your glucose levels. Most CGM systems use a tiny sensor that is inserted under your skin. The sensor measures your glucose level every few minutes. It can show changes in your glucose level throughout the day and night. A CGM system is especially useful for people who take insulin and have problems with low blood glucose.  Your provider will also check your blood glucose with a blood test called an A1C.  It checks your average blood glucose level over the past three months. People with diabetes usually have an A1C test at least twice a year. But you may need the test more often if you aren't meeting your diabetes treatment goals.  What happens if my blood glucose level becomes too high? High blood glucose is called hyperglycemia. Symptoms that your blood glucose levels may be too high include:  Feeling thirsty Feeling tired or weak Headaches Urinating (peeing) often Blurred vision   If you often have high blood glucose levels or symptoms of high blood glucose, talk with your health care team. You may need a change in your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, or diabetes medicines.  High blood glucose may also be caused by other conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood. These conditions include problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands.  What happens if my blood glucose level becomes low for me? Hypoglycemia, also called low blood glucose, happens when your blood glucose level drops below what is healthy for you. For many people with diabetes, this means a blood glucose reading lower than 70 mg/dL. Your number might be different, so check with your health care team to find out what blood glucose level is low for you.  Symptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly. The symptoms can be different for everyone, but they may include:  Shaking Sweating Nervousness or anxiety Irritability or confusion Dizziness Hunger   Low blood glucose levels can be common in people with type 1 diabetes and people with type 2 diabetes who take certain diabetes medicines. If you think you may have low blood glucose, check your level, even if you don't have symptoms. Low blood glucose can be dangerous and should be treated as soon as possible.  Although it's rare, you can still get low blood glucose without having diabetes. The causes can include conditions such as liver disease, kidney disease, and hormone deficiencies (lack of certain hormones). Some medicines, such as certain heart medicines and antibiotics, can also cause it. See your provider to find out the cause of your low blood glucose and how to treat it.

    "disease": "Blood Pressure Medicines",
    "summary": "What is high blood pressure? High blood pressure, also called hypertension, is when blood puts too much pressure against the walls of your arteries. Almost half of American adults have high blood pressure, usually with no symptoms. But it can cause serious problems such as stroke, heart failure, heart attack, and kidney disease.  What lifestyle changes can help lower high blood pressure? Healthy lifestyle changes can help reduce high blood pressure:  Losing weight Being physically active Managing stress Reducing sodium in your diet Avoiding alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs Getting enough sleep\t   What if lifestyle changes alone cannot lower blood pressure? Sometimes lifestyle changes alone cannot control or lower your high blood pressure. In that case, your health care provider may prescribe blood pressure medicines.  How do blood pressure medicines work? The most commonly used blood pressure medicines work in different ways to lower blood pressure:  Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) keep your blood vessels from narrowing as much and allows blood to move through them with less pressure. Beta blockers help your heart beat slower and with less force. This means that your heart pumps less blood through your blood vessels. Beta blockers are typically used only as a backup option or if you also have certain other conditions. Calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from entering the muscle cells of your heart and blood vessels. This allows the blood vessels to relax. Diuretics remove extra water and sodium (salt) from your body. This lowers the amount of fluid in your blood. Diuretics are often used with other high blood pressure medicines, sometimes in one combined pill.  Often, two or more medicines work better than one. If these medicines do not lower your blood pressure enough, your provider may suggest that you take another type of blood pressure medicine.  While taking the medicines, it is still important to keep up with your healthy lifestyle changes. Doing both helps keep blood pressure lower than lifestyle changes or medicines alone.

    "disease": "Blood Thinners",
    "summary": "What are blood thinners? Blood thinners are medicines that prevent blood clots from forming. They do not break up clots that you already have. But they can stop those clots from getting bigger. It's important to treat blood clots, because clots in your blood vessels and heart can cause heart attacks, strokes, and blockages.   Who needs blood thinners? You may need a blood thinner if you have:  Certain heart or blood vessel diseases An abnormal heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation A heart valve replacement A risk of blood clots after surgery Congenital heart defects   What are the different types of blood thinners? There are different types of blood thinners:  Anticoagulants, such as heparin or warfarin (also called Coumadin), slow down your body's process of making clots.  Antiplatelets, such as aspirin and clopidogrel, prevent blood cells called platelets from clumping together to form a clot. Antiplatelets are mainly taken by people who have had a heart attack or stroke.   How can I take blood thinners safely? When you take a blood thinner, follow the directions carefully. Blood thinners may interact with certain foods, medicines, vitamins, and alcohol. Make sure that your health care provider knows all of the medicines and supplements you are using.  You may need regular blood tests to check how well your blood is clotting. It is important to make sure that you're taking enough medicine to prevent clots, but not so much that it causes bleeding.    What are the side effects of blood thinners? Bleeding is the most common side effect of blood thinners. They can also cause an upset stomach, nausea, and diarrhea.   Other possible side effects can depend on which type of blood thinner that you are taking.  Call your provider if you have any sign of serious bleeding, such as:  Menstrual bleeding that is much heavier than normal Red or brown urine Bowel movements that are red or black Bleeding from the gums or nose that does not stop quickly Vomit that is brown or bright red Coughing up something red Severe pain, such as a headache or stomachache Unusual bruising A cut that does not stop bleeding A serious fall or bump on the head Dizziness or weakness",

You may need it if you have been badly burned, have liver failure or a severe infection.   Most blood transfusions go very smoothly.  Some infectious agents, such as HIV, can survive in blood and infect the person receiving the blood transfusion. To keep blood safe, blood banks carefully screen donated blood. The risk of catching a virus from a blood transfusion is low.  Sometimes it is possible to have a transfusion of your own blood. During surgery, you may need a blood transfusion because of blood loss. If you are having a surgery that you're able to schedule months in advance, your doctor may ask whether you would like to use your own blood, instead of donated blood.

    "summary": "What are body lice? Body lice (also called clothes lice) are tiny insects which live and lay nits (lice eggs) on clothing. They are parasites, and they need to feed on human blood to survive. They usually only move to the skin to feed.  Body lice are one of the three types of lice that live on humans. The other two types are head lice and pubic lice. Each type of lice is different, and getting one type does not mean that you will get another type.  Body lice can spread diseases, such as typhus, trench fever, and relapsing fever.  How do body lice spread? Body lice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. One way that they spread is through physical contact with a person who has body lice. They can also spread through contact with clothing, beds, bed linens, or towels that were used by a person with body lice. You cannot get lice from animals.  Who is at risk for body lice? Body lice is most common in people who cannot bathe and wash their clothes regularly, especially if they live in crowded conditions. In the United States, this is most often people experiencing homelessness. In other countries, body lice can also affect refugees and victims of war or natural disasters.  What are the symptoms of body lice? The most common symptom of body lice is intense itching. There may also be a rash, which is caused by an allergic reaction to the bites. The itching causes some people to scratch until they get sores. Sometimes these sores can become infected with bacteria or fungi.  If someone has body lice for a long time, the heavily bitten areas of their skin can become thickened and discolored. This is most common around your midsection (waist, groin, and upper thighs).  How do you know if you have body lice? A diagnosis of body lice usually comes from finding nits and crawling lice in the seams of clothing. Sometimes a body louse can be seen crawling or feeding on the skin. Other times it takes a magnifying lens to see the lice or nits.  What are the treatments for body lice? The main treatment for body lice is to improve personal hygiene. That means regular showers and washing clothes, bedding, and towels at least once a week. Use hot water to wash the laundry, and dry it using the hot cycle of the dryer. Some people may also need a lice-killing medicine.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

That's because your weight includes muscle, bone, fat, and water. Also, everyday factors can play a role in your weight, such as your:  Diet Activity level  Stress level  Sleep habits Family history and genetics   Age    What factors help determine a healthy body weight? A healthy weight is more than just a number on the scale. It's about feeling good, having energy, and lowering your risk of disease. Your health care provider can help you determine a healthy body weight based on several factors. These include your:  Body Mass Index (BMI). BMI is a measure of how much you weigh compared to how tall you are. The higher your BMI, the higher your risk for certain diseases. BMI does not distinguish between fat, muscle, and bone mass. It also may overestimate body fat in athletes or those with a muscular build, or underestimate body fat in older persons or others who have lost muscle. Waist circumference. If most of your body fat is around your abdomen (belly) rather than your hips, you may be at a higher risk for heart disease and type 2 diabetes.  Health history. Your health care provider will likely consider your risk factors for diseases and health conditions, such as having high cholesterol, in determining your healthy body weight.   What are body weight ranges?  Having a healthy body weight may lower your chance of developing certain health problems. Carrying too much or too little weight can affect your health. Ranges of body weight include:   Underweight. Your weight is lower than it should be for your health. Normal. Your weight is within a healthy range. Overweight. Your weight is greater than it should be for your health.  Obese. Your body fat is greater than it should be for your health.   Body weight needs can be different at different ages. For children, weight and growth are tracked over time based on their age.  For older adults, keeping muscle and strength is key, and sudden weight loss should always be checked by your provider.  What if I have a sudden gain or loss of weight? Talk to your provider if you're losing or gaining weight without trying. A sudden, unexpected change in weight can be a sign of a medical problem.     Causes for sudden weight loss can include:   Thyroid problems Cancer Infectious diseases Digestive diseases Certain medicines   Causes for sudden weight gain can include:   Certain medicines Thyroid problems Heart failure Kidney disease Liver disease   How can I maintain a healthy body weight? Maintaining a healthy body weight can improve energy, sleep, and overall wellbeing. Talk to your provider about what a healthy weight would be for you. If they recommend that you gain or lose weight, they might refer you to a dietician for support. A dietician is a professional who has special training to help you learn the best way to eat.   Good nutrition and exercise can help in losing weight. Even a small change in weight can lower your risk of developing certain diseases. Eating extra calories within a well-balanced diet and treating any underlying medical problems can help you gain weight.   Focus on your health, not just the number on the scale.

But when more bone is broken down than replaced, you lose bone density, also called bone mass. Bone density is a measure of the amount of calcium and other minerals in bone. Bones containing more minerals are denser. They tend to be stronger and less likely to fracture (break).  Losing bone density can weaken your bones. In some cases, it can lead to osteoporosis. This is a disease which can make your bones more likely to break. Low bone density that is not low enough to be osteoporosis is sometimes called osteopenia.  What can make you lose bone density? Your bones become less dense as you age. Other factors can also make you more likely to lose bone mass, such as:  A family history of osteoporosis or low bone mass Not developing good bone mass when you are young Having certain medical conditions, such as: \t \t\tEndocrine diseases \t\tCertain digestive diseases \t\tRheumatoid arthritis \t\tCertain types of cancer \t\tHIV \t\tAnorexia nervosa, a type of eating disorder \t  Taking certain medicines, such as:  \t \t\tCorticosteroids \t\tProton pump inhibitors (which treat GERD) \t\tMedicines to treat epilepsy \t   Smoking tobacco Long-term heavy alcohol use Physical inactivity or prolonged periods of bedrest   Not everyone who has low bone mass gets osteoporosis, but they are at higher risk for developing it.

    "summary": "What is breast cancer?  Breast cancer is a cancer that starts in breast tissue.  It happens when cells in the breast change and grow out of control. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor.   Sometimes the cancer does not spread any further. This is called \"in situ.\" If the cancer spreads outside the breast, the cancer is called \"invasive.\" It may just spread to nearby tissues and lymph nodes. Or the cancer may metastasize (spread to other parts of the body) through the lymph system or the blood.   Breast cancer is the second most common type of cancer in women in the United States. Rarely, it can also affect men.  What are the types of breast cancer? There are different types of breast cancer. The types are based on which breast cells turn into cancer. The types include:  Ductal carcinoma, which begins in the cells of the ducts. This is the most common type. Lobular carcinoma, which begins in the lobules. It is more often found in both breasts than other types of breast cancer. Inflammatory breast cancer, in which cancer cells block lymph vessels in the skin of the breast. The breast becomes warm, red, and swollen. This is a rare type. Paget's disease of the breast, which is a cancer involving the skin of the nipple. It usually also affects the darker skin around the nipple. It is also rare.   What causes breast cancer? Breast cancer happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA). Often, the exact cause of these genetic changes is unknown.   But sometimes these genetic changes are inherited, meaning that you are born with them. Breast cancer that is caused by inherited genetic changes is called hereditary breast cancer.   There are also certain genetic changes that can raise your risk of breast cancer, including changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. These two changes also raise your risk of ovarian and other cancers.  Besides genetics, your lifestyle and the environment can affect your risk of breast cancer.  Who is at risk for breast cancer? The factors that raise your risk of breast cancer include:   Older age History of breast cancer or benign (noncancer) breast disease Inherited risk of breast cancer, including having BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene changes Dense breast tissue A reproductive history that leads to more exposure to the estrogen hormone, including: \t \t\tMenstruating at an early age \t\tBeing at an older age when you first gave birth or never having given birth \t\tStarting menopause at a later age \t  Taking hormone therapy for symptoms of menopause Radiation therapy to the breast or chest Obesity Drinking alcohol   What are the signs and symptoms of breast cancer? The signs and symptoms of breast cancer include  A new lump or thickening in or near the breast or in the armpit. A change in the size or shape of the breast. A dimple or puckering in the skin of the breast. It may look like the skin of an orange. A nipple turned inward into the breast. Nipple discharge other than breast milk. The discharge might happen suddenly, be bloody, or happen in only one breast. Scaly, red, or swollen skin in the nipple area or the breast. Pain in any area of the breast.   How is breast cancer diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose breast cancer and figure out which type you have:  A physical exam, including a clinical breast exam (CBE). This involves checking for any lumps or anything else that seems unusual with the breasts and armpits. A medical history. Imaging tests, such as a mammogram, an ultrasound, or an MRI. Breast biopsy. Blood chemistry tests, which measure different substances in the blood, including electrolytes, fats, proteins, glucose (sugar), and enzymes. Some of the specific blood chemistry tests include a basic metabolic panel (BMP), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and an electrolyte panel.    If these tests show that you have breast cancer, you will have tests that study the cancer cells. These tests help your provider decide which treatment would be best for you. The tests may include:  Genetic tests for genetic changes such in the BRCA and TP53 genes. HER2 test. HER2 is a protein involved with cell growth. It is on the outside of all breast cells. If your breast cancer cells have more HER2 than normal, they can grow more quickly and spread to other parts of the body. An estrogen and progesterone receptor test. This test measures the amount of estrogen and progesterone (hormones) receptors in cancer tissue. If there are more receptors than normal, the cancer is called estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive. This type of breast cancer may grow more quickly.   Another step is staging the cancer. Staging involves doing tests to find out whether the cancer has spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. The tests may include other diagnostic imaging tests and a sentinel lymph node biopsy. This biopsy is done to see whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.  What are the treatments for breast cancer? Treatments for breast cancer include:  Surgery such as  \t \t\tA mastectomy, which removes the whole breast \t\tA lumpectomy to remove the cancer and some normal tissue around it, but not the breast itself \t  Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Hormone therapy, which blocks cancer cells from getting the hormones they need to grow Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells Immunotherapy   Can breast cancer be prevented? You may be able to help prevent breast cancer by making healthy lifestyle changes such as:  Staying at a healthy weight Limiting alcohol use Getting enough exercise Limiting your exposure to estrogen by  \t\t \t\tBreastfeeding your babies if you can \t\tLimiting hormone therapy \t    If you are at high risk, your provider may suggest that you take certain medicines to lower the risk. Some women at very high risk may decide to get a mastectomy (of their healthy breasts) to prevent breast cancer.  It's also important to get regular mammograms. They may be able to identify breast cancer in the early stages, when it is easier to treat.  NIH: National Cancer Institute",

Although many women fear cancer, most breast changes are benign, meaning they are not cancer. These breast changes are known as benign breast disease. See your health care provider if you have a breast lump, pain, discharge, or skin irritation. Minor and serious breast problems often have similar symptoms and may need treatment.  Common breast changes and conditions can include:  Fibrocystic breast changes can include lumpiness, thickening, and swelling, often just before your period. Your breasts may feel painful, swollen, or tender. Cysts are fluid-filled lumps that may be tender. Fibroadenomas are solid, round, rubbery lumps that easily move when pushed, occurring most in younger women. Intraductal papillomas are wart-like benign tumors that grow in the milk duct of the breast.  Blocked milk ducts. Milk production when you're not breastfeeding.   What are the symptoms of breast disease? Symptoms depend on the type of breast disease. Benign breast diseases may not have any symptoms, or they could include:  A lump or firm feeling in your breast or under your arm A change in the size or shape of your breast Nipple discharge  Skin changes such as itching, redness or darkening, dimples, scaling, or puckering on your breast or nipple Painful, swollen, or tender breasts   See your provider if you're noticing any of these symptoms or other unusual changes. Some symptoms may be warning signs or symptoms of breast cancer.  How are breast diseases diagnosed? Some breast changes may be felt or seen. You may notice a change in your breast, or your provider may notice it during a clinical breast exam. Other breast changes may only be found during a screening mammogram or other imaging tests such as an MRI or ultrasound. Your provider may also recommend a breast biopsy  to check a suspicious change in your breast.  What are the treatments for breast disease? Some benign breast changes may increase your risk of breast cancer in the future and may need treatment now. Treatment depends on the type of breast disease that you have.

For example, bullies may try to use physical strength, embarrassing information, or popularity to harm others.  Repetition, meaning it happens more than once or that it probably will happen again    What are the types of bullying?  There are three types of bullying: Physical bullying involves hurting a person's body or belongings. Examples include hitting, kicking, and stealing or breaking someone's stuff. Social bullying (also called relational bullying) hurts someone's reputation or relationships. Some examples are spreading rumors, embarrassing someone in public, and making someone feel left out. Verbal bullying is saying or writing mean things, including name-calling, taunting, and threatening   What is cyberbullying?  Cyberbullying is bullying that happens through text messages or online. It could be through emails, social media, forums, or gaming. Some examples are: Posting rumors on social media Sharing embarrassing pictures or videos online Sharing someone else's private information online (doxing) Making threats against someone online Creating fake accounts and posting information to embarrass someone   Certain types of cyberbullying can be illegal. The laws on cyberbullying are different from state to state.  How is cyberbullying different from bullying?  Cyberbullying is a type of bullying, but there are some differences between the two. Cyberbullying can be: Anonymous - people can hide their identities when they are online or using a cell phone Persistent - people can send messages instantly, at any time of the day or night Permanent - a lot of electronic communication is permanent and public, unless it's reported and removed. A bad online reputation can affect getting into college, getting a job, and other areas of life. This applies to the bully as well. Hard to notice - teachers and parents may not overhear or see cyberbullying taking place   Which children are more likely to be bullied?  Children are more likely to be bullied if they: Are seen as different from their peers, such as being overweight or underweight, dressing differently, or being of a different race/ethnicity Are seen as weak Have depression, anxiety, or low self-esteem Don't have many friends or are less popular Don't socialize well with others Have an intellectual or developmental disability   Which children are more likely to be bullies?  There are two types of children who are more likely to bully others: Children who are well-connected to peers, have social power, are overly worried about popularity, and like to be in charge of others Children who are more isolated from peers, may be depressed or anxious, have low self-esteem, are easily pressured by peers, and have trouble understanding other people's feelings   There are certain factors that make someone more likely to be a bully.

Bullying is a serious problem that causes harm. And it doesn't just hurt the person who is being bullied; it can also be harmful for the bullies and for any kids who witness the bullying.  Kids who are bullied can have problems at school and with their mental and physical health. They are at risk for: Depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. These problems sometimes last into adulthood. Health complaints, including headaches and stomachaches Lower grades and test scores  Missing and dropping out of school   Kids who bully others have a higher risk for substance use, problems in school, and violence later in life.  Kids who witness bullying are more likely to abuse drugs or alcohol and have mental health problems. They may also miss or skip school.  What are the signs of being bullied?  Often, kids who are being bullied don't report it. They may fear a backlash from the bully, or they may think that no one cares. Sometimes they feel too ashamed to talk about it. So it is important to know the signs of a bullying problem: Depression, loneliness, or anxiety Low self-esteem Headaches, stomachaches, or poor eating habits Disliking school, not wanting to go to school, or getting worse grades than before Self-destructive behaviors, such as running away from home, harming themselves, or talking about suicide Unexplained injuries Lost or destroyed clothing, books, electronics, or jewelry Trouble sleeping or frequent nightmares Sudden loss of friends or avoidance of social situations   How do you help someone who is being bullied?  To help a child who is being bullied, support the child and address the bullying behavior: Listen and focus on the child. Learn what's been going on and show you want to help.   Assure the child that bullying is not his/her fault Know that kids who are bullied may struggle with talking about it. Consider referring them to a school counselor, psychologist, or other mental health service. Give advice about what to do. This may involve role-playing and thinking through how the child might react if the bullying occurs again. Work together to resolve the situation and protect the bullied child. The child, parents, and school or organization should be part of the solution. Follow up. Bullying may not end overnight. Make sure that the child knows that you are committed to making it stop.  Make sure that the bully knows that his or her behavior is wrong and harms others Show kids that bullying is taken seriously. Make it clear to everyone that the bullying will not be tolerated.

    "summary": "What is C. diff?  C. diff is a bacterium that can cause diarrhea and more serious intestinal conditions such as colitis. You may see it called other names, such as Clostridioides difficile (the new name), Clostridium difficile (an older name), and C. difficile. It causes close to half a million illnesses each year.   What causes C. diff infections? C. diff bacteria are commonly found in the environment, but people usually only get C. diff infections when they are taking antibiotics. That's because antibiotics not only wipe out bad germs, but they also kill the good germs that protect your body against infections. The effect of antibiotics can last as long as several months. If you come in contact with C. diff germs during this time, you can get sick. You are more likely to get a C. diff infection if you take antibiotics for more than a week. C. diff spreads when people touch food, surfaces, or objects that are contaminated with feces (poop) from a person who has C. diff.   Who is more likely to get a C. diff infection? You are at more likely to get a C. diff infection if you: Are taking antibiotics Are 65 or older Recently stayed in a hospital or nursing home Have a weakened immune system Have had a previous infection with C. diff or were exposed to it   What are the symptoms of C. diff infections? The symptoms of C. diff infections include: Diarrhea (loose, watery stools) or frequent bowel movements for several days Fever Stomach tenderness or pain Loss of appetite Nausea   Severe diarrhea causes you to lose a lot of fluids. This can put you at risk for dehydration.   How are C. diff infections diagnosed? If you have been taking antibiotics recently and have symptoms of a C. diff infection, you should see your health care provider. Your provider will ask about your symptoms and do a lab test of your stool. In some cases, you might also need an imaging test such as an x-ray or CT scan to check for complications.\t   What are the treatments for C. diff infections? Certain antibiotics can treat C. diff infections. If you were already taking a different antibiotic when you got C. diff, your provider may ask you to stop taking that one.  If you have a severe case, you may need to stay in the hospital. If you have very severe pain or serious complications, you may need surgery to remove the diseased part of your colon.  About 1 in 6 people who have had a C. diff infection will get it again within the following 2 to 8 weeks. This is called recurrent C. diff. It could be that your original infection came back or that you have a new infection. Contact your provider if your symptoms come back.   For people who keep getting C. diff infections, treatments such as fecal microbiota transplants (FMT) have shown promising results. FMT uses stool (or bacteria from stool) from a healthy donor to try to restore the balance of healthy bacteria in your intestines.   Can C. diff infections be prevented? There are steps you can take to try to prevent getting or spreading C. diff: Wash your hands with soap and water after you use the bathroom and before you eat.  If you have diarrhea, clean the bathroom that you used before anyone else uses it. Use bleach mixed with water or another disinfectant to clean the toilet seat, handle, and lid.   Health care providers can also help prevent C. diff infections by taking infection control precautions and improving how they prescribe antibiotics.   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

    "summary": "What is caffeine? Caffeine is a bitter substance that occurs naturally in more than 60 plants including: Coffee beans Tea leaves Kola nuts, which are used to flavor soft drink colas Cacao pods, which are used to make chocolate products   There is also synthetic (man-made) caffeine, which is added to some medicines, foods, and drinks. For example, some pain relievers, cold medicines, and over-the-counter medicines for alertness contain synthetic caffeine. So do energy drinks and \"energy-boosting\" gums and snacks.  Most people consume caffeine from drinks. The amount of caffeine in different drinks can vary a lot, but it is generally: An 8-ounce cup of coffee: 95-200 mg A 12-ounce can of cola: 35-45 mg An 8-ounce energy drink: 70-100 mg An 8-ounce cup of tea: 14-60 mg   What are caffeine's effects on the body? Caffeine has many effects on your body's metabolism. It: Stimulates your central nervous system, which can make you feel more awake and give you a boost of energy Is a diuretic, meaning that it helps your body get rid of extra salt and water by urinating more Increases the release of acid in your stomach, sometimes leading to an upset stomach or heartburn May interfere with the absorption of calcium in the body Increases your blood pressure   Within one hour of eating or drinking caffeine, it reaches its peak level in your blood. You may continue to feel the effects of caffeine for four to six hours.  What are the side effects from too much caffeine? For most people, it is not harmful to consume up to 400mg of caffeine a day. If you do eat or drink too much caffeine, it can cause health problems, such as: Restlessness and shakiness Insomnia Headaches Dizziness Fast heart rate Dehydration Anxiety Dependency, so you need to take more of it to get the same results   Some people are more sensitive to the effects of caffeine than others.  What are energy drinks, and why can they be a problem? Energy drinks are beverages that have added caffeine. The amount of caffeine in energy drinks can vary widely, and sometimes the labels on the drinks do not give you the actual amount of caffeine in them. Energy drinks may also contain sugars, vitamins, herbs, and supplements.   Companies that make energy drinks claim that the drinks can increase alertness and improve physical and mental performance. This has helped make the drinks popular with American teens and young adults. There's limited data showing that energy drinks might temporarily improve alertness and physical endurance. There is not enough evidence to show that they enhance strength or power. But what we do know is that energy drinks can be dangerous because they have large amounts of caffeine. And since they have lots of sugar, they can contribute to weight gain and worsen diabetes.  Sometimes young people mix their energy drinks with alcohol. It is dangerous to combine alcohol and caffeine. Caffeine can interfere with your ability to recognize how drunk you are, which can lead you to drink more. This also makes you more likely to make bad decisions.  Who should avoid or limit caffeine? You should check with your health care provider about whether you should limit or avoid caffeine if you:  Are pregnant, since caffeine passes through the placenta to your baby. Are breastfeeding, since a small amount of caffeine that you consume is passed along to your baby. Have sleep disorders, including insomnia. Have migraines or other chronic headaches. Have anxiety. Have GERD or ulcers. Have arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat). Have high blood pressure. Take certain medicines or supplements, including stimulants, certain antibiotics, asthma medicines, and heart medicines. Check with your health care provider about whether there might be interactions between caffeine and any medicines and supplements that you take. Are a child or teen. Neither should have as much caffeine as adults. Children can be especially sensitive to the effects of caffeine.   What is caffeine withdrawal? If you have been consuming caffeine on a regular basis and then suddenly stop, you may have caffeine withdrawal. Symptoms can include: Headaches Drowsiness Irritability Nausea Trouble concentrating   These symptoms usually go away after a couple of days.",

    "disease": "Calcium",
    "summary": "What is calcium and why do I need it? Calcium is a mineral, a nutrient that you need (in small amounts) to keep your body healthy. You have more calcium in your body than any other mineral.  Calcium has many important jobs:  To build and maintain strong bones. Your body stores almost all of its calcium in your bones and teeth to keep them strong. To help your muscles move. To help your nerves to carry messages between your brain and the rest of your body. To help your blood vessels move blood throughout your body. To help release hormones that affect many functions in your body.   Not getting enough calcium can cause several conditions, including:  Osteoporosis, a disease which can make your bones weaker and more likely to break. Rickets, a disease in children that causes soft, weak bones. Osteomalacia, a condition which causes soft bones in children and adults.   How do I get calcium? You can get calcium from foods and supplements. You may be able to get enough calcium by eating a variety of foods, including:  Dairy products such as milk, cheese, and yogurt. These are the main food sources of calcium for most people in the United States. Leafy, green vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and Chinese cabbage (bok choi). Fish with soft bones that you can eat, such as canned sardines and salmon. Calcium-enriched foods such as breakfast cereals, fruit juices, soy and rice drinks, and tofu. The product labels for these foods will show how much calcium they have.   Calcium is available in supplements. It is also included in many multivitamins. The two main forms of calcium supplements are calcium carbonate and calcium citrate:  Calcium carbonate is absorbed best when taken with food. Some over-the-counter antacids, such as Tums and Rolaids, also contain calcium carbonate. Calcium citrate is absorbed well on an empty stomach or a full stomach. People with low levels of stomach acid absorb calcium citrate more easily than calcium carbonate.   Calcium is absorbed best when you take 500 mg or less at one time. If you are taking more than that amount each day, take a smaller dose twice a day rather than taking it all at once.  Calcium supplements might cause gas, bloating, and constipation in some people. If you have any of these symptoms, you could try:  Spreading out the calcium dose throughout the day Taking it with meals Switching the form of calcium you take   How much calcium do I need? The amount of calcium you need each day depends on your age and other factors.  The recommended amounts, in milligrams (mg), are:   Birth to 6 months: 200 mg Infants 7-12 months: 260 mg Children 1-3 years: 700 mg Children 4-8 years: 1,000 mg Children 9-13 years: 1,300 mg Teens 14-18 years: 1,300 mg Adults 19-50 years: 1,000 mg Adult men 51-70 years: 1,000 mg Adult women 51-70 years: 1,200 mg Adults 71 years and older: 1,200 mg Pregnant and breastfeeding teens: 1,300 mg Pregnant and breastfeeding adults: 1,000 mg   Certain people may have trouble getting enough calcium, including:  Children and teens age 4 to 18 years People who are Black or Asian Adults age 50 years and older living in poverty Postmenopausal women; your body absorbs and retains less calcium after menopause People who don't drink milk or eat other dairy products   Check with your health care provider to see if you need to take calcium supplements, and if so, how much you should take. Your provider may want to first do a calcium blood test to see if you are getting enough of it.  NIH: National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements",

    "disease": "Cancer",
    "summary": "What is cancer? Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Usually, your body forms new cells as needed, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor.  Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer, while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of your body. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the type of cancer and how advanced it is.  What are the types of cancer? There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Cancer can start almost anywhere in your body. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast.  Cancer may also be described by the type of cell that formed it, such as sarcoma if cancer begins in your bone and soft tissue. Carcinoma is the most common type of cancer. It is formed by epithelial cells, the cells that cover the inside and outside surfaces of your body.   How does cancer develop? Cancer is a genetic disease. That means changes in your genes cause it. Changes in your genes are also called gene variants or mutations. Genes are parts of DNA in your cells that you inherit from your parents. However, only some cancers are caused by genes passed down from your parents.   Genetic changes can occur to your genes over your lifetime that affect how your cells function. Usually, your body gets rid of damaged cells before they turn cancerous, but this ability goes down as you age. Other factors that may affect your risk of developing cancer can include:  Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun Smoking Your diet Physical inactivity   What are the symptoms of cancer? Cancer symptoms depend on the type of cancer. For example, some of the symptoms that cancer may cause can include:  A lump in your breast Blood in your urine (pee) or stool (poop) Bleeding or bruising for no known reason A sore that doesn't heal Trouble swallowing A new mole or a change to a mole you already have   Cancer may cause various symptoms but often doesn't cause pain. Don't wait until you're having pain before seeing your health care provider. See your provider if you have symptoms that don't get better in a few weeks.   How is cancer diagnosed? There is no single test that can diagnose cancer. The tests ordered are usually based on your symptoms. Your provider may:  Ask about your medical history Ask about your family health history, including relatives who have had cancer Do a physical exam Do a screening test such as a mammogram, colonoscopy, or a Pap test  Order blood tests or imaging tests   To find out if you have cancer, your provider may order a biopsy. A biopsy is the procedure of removing and examining tissue, cells, or fluids from your body.  What are the treatments for cancer? Treatment depends on the type of cancer and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery, radiation, and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy, immunotherapy or other types of biological therapy, or stem cell transplantation.    Can cancer be prevented? It's usually not possible to know exactly why cancer develops in some people but not others. There are some things that you can't control which may increase or decrease your risk of getting cancer, such as inheriting certain genes or your age. But some lifestyle habits may increase your risk of certain types of cancer. Avoid or reduce lifestyle habits such as:   Smoking and tobacco use Having too much sun exposure  Drinking too much alcohol  Not getting enough physical activity  Having obesity   NIH: National Cancer Institute",

One choice you might consider is using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM is the term for medical products and therapies that are not part of standard medical care.  CAM for cancer treatment involves caring for your mind, body, and spirit. Some methods focus on your breathing or body movements to help you relax. Other CAM therapies may use special foods, supplements, or diets. Examples of CAM therapies include acupuncture, chiropractic, and herbal medicines.  CAM claims can sound promising, but often, researchers don't know how safe some are or how well they work. Studies are ongoing to find out the safety and usefulness of many of these methods.  How are complementary and alternative therapies used for cancer care? If you're thinking about using CAM along with your standard care, it's called integrative medicine. Some methods, such as acupuncture, might help with nausea, pain, and other side effects of cancer treatment.  A few reasons that people with cancer may use CAM include to:  Help cope with the side effects of cancer treatments Ease worries about cancer treatment and related stress Feel that they are doing something more to help their care   CAM treatments don't work for everyone. Some products might interact with your other medicines. Talk to your health care provider about all the different types of treatment you use.

    "summary": "What is cancer chemotherapy? Cancer chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment. It uses medicines to destroy cancer cells.  Normally, your body forms new cells as needed, replacing old cells that die. Cancer cells keep growing without control. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Chemotherapy works by killing the cancer cells, stopping them from spreading, or slowing their growth.    Chemotherapy is used to:  Treat cancer by curing the cancer, lessening the chance it will return, or stopping or slowing its growth. Ease cancer symptoms by shrinking tumors that are causing pain and other problems.   What are the side effects of chemotherapy? Chemotherapy does not just destroy cancer cells. It can also harm some healthy cells, which causes side effects.  You may have a lot of side effects, some side effects, or none at all. It depends on the type and amount of chemotherapy you get and how your body reacts.   Some common side effects are:  Mouth sores  Fatigue Nausea and vomiting  Pain Hair loss   There are ways to prevent or control some side effects. Talk with your health care provider about how to manage them. Healthy cells usually recover after chemotherapy is over, so most side effects go away over time.   What can I expect when getting chemotherapy? You may get chemotherapy in a hospital, at home, at your provider's office, or a medical clinic. You might be given the medicines by mouth, in a shot, as a cream, through a catheter (a thin tube), or intravenously (by IV). Your treatment plan will depend on the type of cancer you have, which chemotherapy medicines are used, the treatment goals, and how your body responds to the medicines.  Chemotherapy may be given alone or with other treatments. You may get treatment every day, every week, or every month. You may have breaks between treatments so that your body has a chance to build new healthy cells.   NIH: National Cancer Institute",

Biological therapy uses substances made from living organisms or versions of these substances made in a lab. Immunotherapy isn't used for all cancers, and the response to treatment varies. If you're getting immunotherapy, your health care provider will monitor your treatment closely.  When is immunotherapy used for cancer treatment? Immunotherapy isn't used as often as other cancer treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. But immunotherapy is used for some types of cancer, and researchers are doing clinical trials to see whether it also works for other types.  How does immunotherapy work against cancer? Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Usually, your body forms new cells as needed, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes, this process goes wrong. When you have cancer, some of your cells begin to multiply without stopping, and old cells don't die when they should. They spread into the surrounding tissues.  One reason cancer cells can keep growing and spreading is that they can hide from your immune system. Some immunotherapies can \"mark\" your cancer cells. This makes it easier for your immune system to find and destroy the cells. It is a type of targeted therapy that uses medicines or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. Other types of immunotherapies work by boosting your immune system to work better against cancer.   How is immunotherapy given? There are different forms of immunotherapy, so how they are given varies. You could get immunotherapy intravenously (by IV), in pills or capsules, or cream for your skin. For bladder cancer, they might place it directly into your bladder.  How often and how long you get immunotherapy also varies. It depends on your type of cancer, how advanced it is, the type of immunotherapy you get, and how well it is working. You may have treatment every day, week, or month. Some immunotherapies are given in cycles, so your body has time to rest and recover.   What are the side effects of immunotherapy? You may have side effects. The most common side effects are skin reactions at the needle site if you get it by IV. Other side effects may include flu-like symptoms or, rarely, severe reactions.

    "summary": "Learning to live with cancer Cancer is a common disease. Many Americans will be diagnosed with cancer during their lifetimes. Even though cancer may be life-threatening, many people have successful treatment. Others live with cancer for a very long time.   For most people with cancer, learning to live with the disease is one of the biggest challenges they've ever faced. That's because having cancer touches just about every part of your life and the lives of those around you.   Cancer and its treatment may change:  Your daily routines and ability to work Your important relationships The way you look, feel, and think about yourself   If you learn what to expect, you may feel more in control and prepared to cope with these changes. Your health care provider can help you find information and support services that are right for you.   Coping with feelings about having cancer   Having cancer may cause a range of strong emotions, such as sadness, anger, fear, worry, or guilt. These feelings are normal, and they're likely to change over time. It's helpful to sort out your feelings in a way that's comfortable for you. You might try:  Talking openly with someone you trust Writing about your feelings Using relaxation methods, such as meditation and other complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) Doing the things you enjoy,  giving yourself a break from focusing on cancer   If your emotions seem to take over your life, tell your provider. You may need extra support if you have symptoms of depression, stress, anxiety, or panic disorder.   Communicating with your health care team During cancer treatment, you usually have a team of providers. Along with doctors and nurses, you may be able to talk with social workers, pharmacists, dietitians, and other health professionals.  These professionals are prepared to help you deal with the issues that cancer brings up, including concerns about finances. But it's up to you to let your team know what's on your mind.  Good communication with your providers may help you feel more in control and satisfied with your care. Your communications may be better if you:  Tell your providers how much you want to know about your cancer and its treatment. Do you want all the details or just the big picture?  Write down your questions and concerns before your visits.  Bring a family member or a friend to your visits. This person can help by listening, taking notes, and asking questions.    Talking openly with family and friends Cancer changes the daily routines and roles of the people who love and support you. They may need to start doing the things you've always done for them. And you may need their help doing things you've always done for yourself. These changes can be difficult for everyone.  It may help to have an honest talk about changing roles and needs. If that sounds too hard, ask a social worker or another member of your care team to help you talk with family and friends who are helping with your care.  These caregivers may need some support, too.   Dealing with changes in your self-image  Cancer and its treatment may cause some big changes in how you look, feel, and think about yourself. For example, you may have:  Less energy Temporary or permanent changes in your body, such as  scars, or hair loss from chemotherapy Problems being sexually close or doubts about dating   Coping with these changes can be hard. But most people find ways to feel more positive over time. If you feel well enough, you might try:  Exercise. Walking, yoga, or other types of movement may help you feel stronger and more in control of your body. But check with your provider first. Staying involved in life and helping others. Think about volunteering, hobbies, or other activities that might make you feel good about yourself.  Counseling for sexual problems. Talking with a professional, either with a partner or on your own, may help.   Adjusting to life after treatment   After treatment, you'll have regular cancer follow-up care. Your provider will explain the schedule of checkups and tests you'll need. This is a good time to discuss the challenges you may face ahead.

Carbohydrate metabolism disorders are a group of metabolic disorders. Normally your enzymes break carbohydrates down into glucose (a type of sugar). If you have one of these disorders, you may not have enough enzymes to break down the carbohydrates. Or the enzymes may not work properly. This causes a harmful amount of sugar to build up in your body. That can lead to health problems, some of which can be serious. Some of the disorders are fatal.  These disorders are inherited. Newborn babies get screened for many of them, using blood tests. If there is a family history of one of these disorders, parents can get genetic testing to see whether they carry the gene. Other genetic tests can tell whether the fetus has the disorder or carries the gene for the disorder.  Treatments may include special diets, supplements, and medicines.

Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose. Glucose, or blood sugar, is the main source of energy for your body's cells, tissues, and organs. Glucose can be used immediately or stored in the liver and muscles for later use.  What are the different types of carbohydrates? There are three main types of carbohydrates:  Sugars. They are also called simple carbohydrates because they are in the most basic form. They can be added to foods, such as the sugar in candy, desserts, processed foods, and regular soda. They also include the kinds of sugar that are found naturally in fruits, vegetables, and milk. Starches. They are complex carbohydrates, which are made of lots of simple sugars strung together. Your body needs to break starches down into sugars to use them for energy. Starches include bread, cereal, and pasta. They also include certain vegetables, like potatoes, peas, and corn.  Fiber. It is also a complex carbohydrate. Your body cannot break down most fibers, so eating foods with fiber can help you feel full and make you less likely to overeat. Diets high in fiber have other health benefits. They may help prevent stomach or intestinal problems, such as constipation. They may also help lower cholesterol and blood sugar. Fiber is found in many foods that come from plants, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, beans, and whole grains.    Which foods have carbohydrates? Common foods with carbohydrates include:  Grains, such as bread, noodles, pasta, crackers, cereals, and rice Fruits, such as apples, bananas, berries, mangoes, melons, and oranges Dairy products, such as milk and yogurt Legumes, including dried beans, lentils, and peas Snack foods and sweets, such as cakes, cookies, candy, and other desserts Juices, regular sodas, fruit drinks, sports drinks, and energy drinks that contain sugar Starchy vegetables, such as potatoes, corn, and peas   Some foods don't have a lot of carbohydrates, such as meat, fish, poultry, some types of cheese, nuts, and oils.   Which types of carbohydrates should I eat? You do need to eat some carbohydrates to give your body energy. But it's important to eat the right kinds of carbohydrates for your health:  When eating grains, choose mostly whole grains and not refined grains: \t  \t\tWhole grains are foods like whole-wheat bread, brown rice, whole cornmeal, and oatmeal. They offer lots of nutrients that your body needs, like vitamins, minerals, and fiber. To figure out whether a product has a lot of whole grain, check the ingredients list on the package and see if a whole grain is one of the first few items listed. \t\tRefined grains are foods that have had some parts of the grains removed. This also removes some of the nutrients that are good for your health. \t   Eat foods with lots of fiber. The Nutrition Facts labels on the back of food packages tells you how much fiber a product has.  Try to avoid foods that have a lot of added sugar. These foods can have many calories but not much nutrition. Eating too much added sugar raises your blood sugar and can make you gain weight. You can tell if a food or drink has added sugars by looking at the Nutrition Facts label on the back of the food package. It tells you how much total sugar and added sugar is in that food or drink.    How many carbohydrates should I eat? There is no one-size-fits-all amount of carbohydrates that people should eat. This amount can vary, depending on factors such as your age, sex, health, and whether or not you are trying to lose or gain weight. On average, people should get 45 to 65% of their calories from carbohydrates every day. On the Nutrition Facts labels, the Daily Value for total carbohydrates is 275 g per day. This is based on a 2,000-calorie daily diet. Your Daily Value may be higher or lower depending on your calorie needs and health.  Is it safe to eat a low-carb diet? Some people go on a low-carb diet to try to lose weight. This usually means eating between 25 g and 150 g of carbs each day. This kind of diet can be safe, but you should talk to your health care provider before starting it. One problem with low-carb diets is that they can limit the amount of fiber you get each day. They can also be hard to stay on for the long term.",

Depression and obesity can raise the risk of these diseases even more. Problems with short-term memory or paying attention   What can I do to prevent or relieve caregiver stress? Taking steps to prevent or relieve caregiver stress may help prevent health problems. Remember that if you feel better, you can take better care of your loved one. It will also be easier to focus on the rewards of caregiving. Some ways to help yourself include: Learning better ways to help your loved one. For examples, hospitals offer classes that can teach you how to care for someone with an injury or illness.  Finding caregiving resources in your community to help you. Many communities have adult daycare services or respite services. Using one of these can give you a break from your caregiving duties. Asking for and accepting help. Make a list of ways others can help you. Let helpers choose what they would like to do. For instance, someone might sit with the person you care for while you do an errand. Someone else might pick up groceries for you. Joining a support group for caregivers. A support group can allow you to share stories, pick up caregiving tips, and get support from others who face the same challenges as you do. Being organized to make caregiving more manageable. Make to-do lists and set a daily routine. Staying in touch with family and friends. It's important for you to have emotional support. Taking care of your own health. Try to find time to be physically active on most days of the week, choose healthy foods, and get enough sleep. Make sure that you keep up with your medical care such as regular checkups and screenings. Considering taking a break from your job, if you also work and are feeling overwhelmed.

If you have carotid artery disease, the arteries become narrow or blocked, usually because of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is the buildup of plaque, which is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood.   Carotid artery disease is serious because it can block the blood flow to your brain, causing a stroke. Too much plaque in the artery can cause a blockage. You can also have a blockage when a piece of plaque or a blood clot breaks off the wall of an artery. The plaque or clot can travel through the bloodstream and get stuck in one of your brain's smaller arteries.  Carotid artery disease often does not cause symptoms until the blockage or narrowing is severe.  One sign may be a bruit (whooshing sound) that your doctor hears when listening to your artery with a stethoscope. Another sign is a transient ischemic attack (TIA), a \"mini-stroke.\" A TIA is like a stroke, but it only lasts a few minutes, and the symptoms usually go away within an hour.

    "summary": "What is carpal tunnel syndrome? Carpal tunnel syndrome is the name for a group of problems that includes numbness, tingling, weakness, or pain in your wrist or hand. It's a very common condition that happens when a nerve in your wrist becomes squeezed.  The carpal tunnel is a narrow opening between the bones in your wrist and the ligament that holds them together.  A nerve, called the median nerve, runs from your lower arm through the carpal tunnel and into your hand. This nerve provides feeling to your thumb and first three fingers.  It also helps you move your thumb.  Tendons also run from your lower arm, through the carpal tunnel, and into your hand. The tendons connect your finger bones to muscles in your arm, so you can bend your fingers. If the tendons become swollen or irritated inside the carpal tunnel, they may press on the nerve. The squeezed nerve may not work well, which can lead to numbness, weakness, and other symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.   What causes carpal tunnel syndrome? In certain cases, the cause of carpal tunnel syndrome is unknown. But it usually happens from a combination of things that affect the structures in your wrist, such as:  Injury to your wrist that causes swelling, such as a sprain or broken bone Health conditions that can affect your nerves, joints, or other parts of your wrist, for example: \t \t\tDiabetes. \t\tRheumatoid arthritis. \t\tA cyst or tumor in your wrist. \t\tChanges in  certain hormones, which may cause swelling from extra fluid in your body. Examples include an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism), pregnancy and menopause. \t\tProblems with the way your wrist is formed. \t  Doing the same wrist and hand movements over and over, such as:  \t \t\tAssembly line work. \t\tCarpentry or using tools that vibrate. \t\tKnitting, gardening, or sports, such as golf. \t   Researchers aren't sure whether long-term typing or computer use leads to carpal tunnel syndrome.   Who is more likely to develop carpal tunnel syndrome? Carpal tunnel syndrome usually happens only in adults. You're more likely to develop it if you:  Are a woman. Women are three times more likely to have carpal tunnel syndrome than men.   Have a health condition that may affect structures in your wrist. Do activities with repeated hand motions.  Have had a wrist injury.  Have a close relative who has had carpal tunnel syndrome, such as a parent, brother or sister.   What are the symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome? You may feel numbness, tingling or burning in your fingers, especially in your thumb, index, and middle fingers. Symptoms often affect both hands.   In the early stages, symptoms usually:  Start slowly in your dominant hand (the one you write with) Happen at night if you sleep with your wrists bent   As symptoms get worse, you may notice:  Tingling, pain, or weakness with certain activities, such as driving or holding a phone Difficulty grasping or holding small things Feeling like your fingers are swollen when they're not  Without treatment, you could lose feeling in some fingers and have permanent weakness in your thumb. But early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent lasting damage.    How is carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosed? To find out if you have carpal tunnel syndrome, your health care provider will:  Ask about your medical history Ask about your family health history Do a physical exam Order tests if needed, such as: \t \t\tLab tests to look for diseases that may damage nerves \t\tX-rays to look for broken bones or arthritis \t\tTests to measure the electrical activity in your nerves and muscles \t\tUltrasound to check the nerve in the carpal tunnel \t    What are the treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome? It's easier to treat carpal tunnel syndrome early on, so you should start treatment as soon as possible. Your provider will first treat any health conditions you have that may cause your symptoms. The next step would be treatments for carpal tunnel syndrome. They may include:  Wrist splints (usually worn at night). Rest.  Medicines to reduce swelling and pain: \t \t\tOver-the-counter pain relievers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen sodium. \t\tPrescription steroids, either pills or an injection (shot) into your wrist.  \t  Other therapies (complementary and integrative medicine). Research shows that yoga may help with pain and weakness. Some people may find acupuncture and chiropractic care helpful, but research hasn't shown that these therapies can improve carpal tunnel syndrome. If you want to try other therapies, talk with your provider first.   Surgery to make more space in the carpal tunnel. Surgery may be an option if your symptoms are severe and other treatments don't work. It involves cutting the wrist ligament to take pressure off the nerve.  Recovery may take months. Carpal tunnel syndrome rarely comes back after surgery, but mild symptoms may last.    Can carpal tunnel syndrome be prevented? You may help prevent carpal tunnel syndrome if you protect your wrists:  Use good posture to keep your wrists in a natural position.  Keep your hands warm to keep your muscles flexible. Fingerless gloves may help.   Take work breaks and vary your tasks. Stretch and exercise your hands and wrists. Organize your workspace and tools to reduce strain on your hands and wrists.",

    "disease": "Cataract",
    "summary": "What are cataracts? A cataract is a clouding of the clear lens inside your eye. This cloudiness blocks light from reaching the back of the eye, making it harder to see clearly. A cataract can affect one or both eyes, but it doesn't spread from one eye to the other.  Cataracts usually develop slowly. As they get worse, your vision can become blurry or dim. Brighter lighting or new eyeglasses may help at first, but if cataracts begin to interfere with your daily activities, you may need cataract surgery.  Without treatment, cataracts can cause severe or even permanent loss of vision.   What causes cataracts? Most cataracts develop as part of the normal aging process. This happens when the protein in the lens of your eye clumps together. Over time, these protein clumps grow larger and thicker, making it harder to see. The lens may turn yellow or brown, which can affect how you see colors.    Cataracts can also develop after an eye injury or surgery for another eye condition, like glaucoma.  Who is more likely to develop cataracts? Cataracts are very common in older adults. By age 80, more than half of all Americans either have a cataract or have had cataract surgery. Your risk for developing cataracts increases as you get older. You may also be at an increased risk if you:  Have certain health problems, like diabetes Have a family history of cataracts Have had an eye injury or eye surgery Take steroid medicines, used to treat conditions like arthritis or allergies Smoke Drink excessive amounts of alcohol Have spent a lot of time in the sun   What are the symptoms of cataracts? You may not notice cataracts at first because they usually develop slowly. That's why regular eye exams are important. Common symptoms may include:  Blurry or cloudy vision Colors that seem faded Glare from headlights, lamps, or sunlight that seems too bright  Halos around lights Not being able to see well at night Double vision (this may go away as the cataract gets bigger) Frequent changes in your glasses or contact lens prescription Trouble reading or doing other everyday activities   Talk with your provider about these symptoms since they could also be signs of other eye problems.  How are cataracts diagnosed? A comprehensive eye exam is the best way to check for cataracts. Your provider will do several tests to check your vision and eye health. This includes a dilated eye exam, where your pupils are widened with special eye drops. This allows more light to enter your eye so your provider can clearly see tissues at the back.  How are cataracts treated? Surgery is the only way to remove a cataract. At first, you may be able to improve your vision with new glasses and brighter lighting. But if cataracts are getting in the way of everyday activities like reading, driving, or watching TV, surgery is an option. During surgery, the cloudy lens is removed and replaced with an artificial lens, called an intraocular lens (IOL).  Can cataracts be prevented? If you're worried that you're at risk for cataracts, talk to your provider to see if there's anything you can do to lower your risk. A few ways to protect your eyes include:   Wear sunglasses and a wide-brimmed hat to block ultraviolet (UV) sunlight and help delay cataracts. Protect your eyes from injury when using power tools or playing certain sports. Eat a healthy diet with plenty of fruits, vegetables, leafy greens, nuts, and whole grains.

    "disease": "Celiac Disease",
    "summary": "What is celiac disease? Celiac disease is a chronic (long-term) digestive and immune disorder that damages your small intestine. The damage may prevent your body from absorbing vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients from the food you eat. This can lead to malnutrition and other serious health problems  Celiac disease is triggered by eating foods that contain gluten. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, rye, and other grains. It may also be in other products like vitamins and supplements, hair and skin products, toothpastes, and lip balm.  Celiac disease is different from gluten sensitivity. Both involve problems with gluten and can cause some of the same symptoms, such as abdominal (belly) pain and fatigue. But gluten sensitivity does not damage the small intestine like celiac disease does.   Wheat allergy, a type of food allergy, is also different. With both celiac disease and wheat allergy, your immune system is reacting to wheat. But with wheat allergy, you can have some different symptoms, such as itchy eyes or trouble breathing. And a wheat allergy will not cause long-term damage to the small intestine.  What causes celiac disease? The exact cause of celiac disease is not known. Research suggests that celiac disease only happens in people who have certain genes and eat food that contains gluten. Researchers are studying other factors that may play a role in causing the disease.  Who is more likely to develop celiac disease? Celiac disease is more common if you:  Have a family member who has the disease Have Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, or Williams syndrome Are White Are female   What are the symptoms of celiac disease? The symptoms of celiac disease can be different from person to person. Sometimes the symptoms may come and go. Some people may not notice any symptoms.  Some of the possible symptoms affect your digestive system. Digestive symptoms are more common in children than in adults. The digestive symptoms include:  Bloating (feeling fullness or swelling in your belly) Chronic (long-term) diarrhea or greasy, bulky, unusually bad-smelling stool (poop) Constipation Gas Lactose intolerance because of damage to the small intestine Nausea and vomiting Pain in the abdomen (belly) Weight loss in adults, or not enough weight gain in children   Some people with celiac disease have symptoms that affect other parts of the body, such as:  Fatigue Depression and anxiety Irritability (in children) Dermatitis herpetiformis, an itchy rash with blisters (mainly in adults) Bone or joint pain Symptoms involving the mouth, such as canker sores or dry mouth   What other problems can celiac disease cause? Over time, celiac disease can cause other health problems, especially if it is not treated. These problems can include:  Malnutrition Anemia, especially iron-deficiency anemia Bone loss Nervous system problems such as headaches, balance problems, or peripheral neuropathy Reproductive problems, such as missed menstrual periods and miscarriages in women and infertility in men and women   How is celiac disease diagnosed? If you have symptoms of celiac disease, your health care provider will look for signs that you might have celiac disease. To do this, your provider will get your medical and family history and do a physical exam.  If your provider thinks that you could have celiac disease, you will have some tests. Providers most often use blood tests and biopsies of the small intestine to diagnose celiac disease. The biopsy would be done during an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. For this procedure, your provider uses an endoscope (a flexible tube with a camera) to see the lining of your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. It also allows your provider to take a sample of tissue for a biopsy.  What are the treatments for celiac disease? The treatment for celiac disease is following a gluten-free diet for the rest of your life. Sticking with a gluten-free diet will treat or prevent many of the symptoms and other health problems caused by celiac disease. In most cases, it can also heal damage in the small intestine and prevent more damage.    Your provider may refer you to a registered dietician (a nutrition expert) who can help you learn how to eat a healthy diet without gluten. You will also need to avoid all hidden sources of gluten, such as certain supplements, cosmetics, toothpaste, etc. Reading product labels can sometimes help you avoid gluten. If a label doesn't tell you what is in a product, check with the company that makes the product for an ingredients list. Don't just assume that a product is gluten-free if it doesn't mention it.

For example, treatments can help to improve their motor skills and ability to communicate.  What are the types of cerebral palsy (CP)? There are different types of CP: Spastic cerebral palsy, which is the most common type. It causes increased muscle tone, stiff muscles, and awkward movements. Sometimes it only affects one part of the body. In other cases, it can affect both arms and legs, the trunk, and the face. Dyskinetic cerebral palsy, which causes problems controlling the movement of the hands, arms, feet, and legs. This can make it hard to sit and walk. Ataxic cerebral palsy, which causes problems with balance and coordination. Mixed cerebral palsy, which means that you have symptoms of more than one type.   What causes cerebral palsy (CP)? CP is caused by abnormal development or damage to the developing brain. When this development or damage happens before birth, it is called congenital CP. Most CP is congenital, and its causes may include:  Gene changes (variants) Brain malformations Infections or fevers in the pregnant parent An injury to the developing baby   CP can also happen during or after birth. CP that happens more than 28 days after birth is called acquired CP. Its causes can include:  Brain damage in the first few months or years of life Infections, such as meningitis or encephalitis Problems with blood flow to the brain, for example from a stroke or abnormal blood vessels Head injuries, for example from a car accident, a fall, or child abuse   In some cases, the cause of congenital or acquired CP is unknown.   Who is more likely to develop cerebral palsy (CP)? Certain medical conditions or events that can happen during pregnancy and delivery may increase a baby's risk of congenital cerebral palsy. These may include:  Being born too small Being born too early Being born a twin or other multiple birth Being conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF) or other assisted reproductive technology (ART) Infections Health problems in the pregnant parent, such as thyroid problems and seizures Severe newborn jaundice Having complications during birth Rh incompatibility Exposure to toxic chemicals during pregnancy   What are the signs of cerebral palsy (CP)? There are many different types and levels of disability with CP. So the signs can be different in each child. These signs usually appear in the early months of life. They may include:   Developmental delays. Your child may be slow to reach developmental milestones such as learning to roll over, sit, crawl, or walk. Abnormal muscle tone. Your child may seem floppy, or they may be stiff or rigid. An unusual posture or favoring one side of the body when reaching, crawling, or moving.  Stiff or tight muscles and exaggerated reflexes (spasticity). Shaking (tremor) of arms, legs, hands, or feet. Sudden, uncontrolled movements.   It's important to know that children without CP can also have these signs. Contact your child's health care provider if your child has any of these signs, so you can get a correct diagnosis.  How is cerebral palsy (CP) diagnosed? Diagnosing CP involves several steps: Developmental monitoring (or surveillance) means tracking a child's growth and development over time. If there are any concerns about your child's development, they should have a developmental screening test as soon as possible. Developmental screening involves giving your child a short test to check for motor, movement, or other developmental delays. If the screenings are not normal, the provider will recommend more evaluations. Developmental and medical evaluations are done to diagnose which disorder your child has. To make the diagnosis, your provider:    Will check your child's motor skills, muscle tone, reflexes, and posture  Will ask about their medical history  May order lab tests, genetic tests, and/or imaging tests      What are the treatments for cerebral palsy (CP)? There is no cure for CP, but treatment can improve the lives of those who have it. It is important to begin a treatment program as early as possible.  A team of health professionals will work with you and your child to develop a treatment plan. Common treatments include: Medicines Surgery Assistive devices such as braces and walkers Physical, occupational, recreational, and speech therapy   Can cerebral palsy (CP) be prevented? You cannot prevent the genetic problems that can cause CP. But it may be possible to manage or avoid some of the risk factors for CP. For example:  If you are pregnant, make sure that you are vaccinated against infections that could cause CP in your developing baby. Get regular prenatal care, which can reduce the risk of preterm birth or having a low birthweight baby. It can also help you manage any health conditions that could raise the risk of CP. Use car seats for your baby to prevent head injuries that could cause CP.",

    "summary": "What is cervical cancer? Cervical cancer is cancer that starts in the cells of the cervix. The cervix is part of the female reproductive system. It is the lower, narrow end of the uterus (womb), which opens into the vagina (birth canal).  Cervical cancer usually develops slowly. Before cervical cells become cancer, they start to look abnormal. These cells are called \"precancers.\" If they aren't destroyed or removed, they may become cancer cells that grow out of control and spread to other parts of your body.  Screening tests for cervical cancer can help find abnormal cells so you can get treatment to prevent cervical cancer. These tests can also find cervical cancer early when it's usually easier to treat.   What causes cervical cancer? Almost all cervical cancers are caused by a long-lasting infection with a virus called human papillomavirus (HPV). There are many types of HPV. The types that cause cancer are called \"high-risk HPV.\" High-risk HPV is very common. It can be passed from one person to another through close skin-to-skin touching, usually during vaginal, anal, or oral sex. Most people who are infected have no symptoms and don't know they have it. If you're infected with high-risk HPV, usually your immune system will get rid of it within a year or two. But if your immune system can't control the infection, it may last for many years. Over time, HPV can turn normal cervical cells into abnormal cells. Without treatment, these cells may keep changing until they become cervical cancer.  Who is more likely to develop cervical cancer? Cervical cancer is most common in people over age 30. If you have a high-risk HPV infection in your cervix, you're more likely to develop cervical cancer if you:  Have a weakened immune system because you: \t \t\tHave a disease that harms your immune system, such as HIV. \t\tTake medicine to control your immune system, such as certain medicines to treat cancer or autoimmune diseases  \t  Smoke tobacco or breathe secondhand smoke.  Use birth control pills or have given birth to many children.  Have obesity. Were exposed to a medicine called DES (diethylstilbestrol) before you were born. Between 1940-1971, DES was sometimes prescribed during pregnancy to prevent miscarriages. DES was later linked to health problems, including cervical cancer.     What are the symptoms of cervical cancer? Cervical cancer usually doesn't cause symptoms when it first starts to grow. But when it does cause symptoms, they may include:  Vaginal bleeding that's not normal for you, such as bleeding after sex or between menstrual periods Vaginal discharge (fluid) that's watery and has a strong odor or contains blood Pelvic pain or pain during sex   If cervical cancer spreads to other parts of your body, symptoms may include:  Unusual vaginal bleeding or discharge Pelvic pain or pain during sex Difficult or painful bowel movements (poops) or bleeding from the rectum when having a bowel movement Difficult or painful urination (peeing) or blood in your urine (pee) Dull backache Swollen legs Abdominal (belly) pain Fatigue   How is cervical cancer diagnosed? If you have symptoms or had an abnormal result on a screening test for cervical cancer, your health care provider will do more tests to find out if you have cervical cancer. They will:  Ask about your medical history and your family health history Do a pelvic exam Suggest tests to diagnose or rule out cervical cancer, including:  \t \t\tColposcopy, a procedure using a device called a colposcope, which helps your provider examine your cervix for abnormal areas  \t\tCervical biopsy, a procedure to remove a tissue sample from your cervix so that it can be examined under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. Most biopsies can be done in your provider's office \t    What are the treatments for cervical cancer? Different treatments are available for cervical cancer. The best treatment for you depends on your health, how much cancer you have, whether it has spread, and which treatment you prefer. You may have more than one treatment, including:  Surgery to remove the cancer.  Radiation therapy, which uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. The therapy may use radiation from a machine, or a radioactive substance may be placed in your body near the cancer.  Chemotherapy (chemo), which uses special medicines to shrink or kill the cancer. The medicine may be pills, or it may be given through a vein (by IV). Sometimes, both types of chemo are used.  Targeted therapy, which uses special medicines to block the growth and spread of cancer cells.  Immunotherapy, which helps your immune system fight cancer cells.   Can cervical cancer be prevented? Almost all cervical cancer can be prevented by:  HPV vaccination. HPV vaccines provide the most protection if you get them before you're exposed to HPV. So, it's best to get vaccinated before you become sexually active.  Medical experts recommend vaccinating children between ages 9 and 12.  Routine cervical cancer screening. Two types of screening tests may be part of your routine health checkup. Both tests use a sample of cervical cells that your provider collects with a swab:  \t \t\tA Pap smear checks for abnormal cells so they can be treated before they become cancer  \t\tAn HPV test checks for high-risk HPV infections that can cause cancer. \t \t Getting the right follow-up treatment if a screening test finds abnormal cells and/or high-risk HPV.   You can lower your risk for cervical cancer by not smoking. Using condoms correctly during sex lowers your risk of getting an HPV infection, but doesn't prevent it completely.  Condom use has been linked to fewer cases of cervical cancer. If you or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.  NIH: National Cancer Institute",

If your screening tests are abnormal, your provider may do more tests, such as a biopsy. How often you should be screened for cervical cancer and which tests you should get will depend on your age and health history.  What are the possible benefits and harms of cervical cancer screening? Cervical cancer screening saves lives. Screening can detect cervical changes early, lowering your chance of dying from cervical cancer. But, cervical cancer screening has potential harms.  The possible harms of cervical cancer screening include: The results can sometimes be wrong.  Getting a false-positive result means that your test results appear abnormal, but there are no precancerous or cancerous cells. A false-positive may lead to:  \t \t\tWorry while you have more tests to look for signs of cancer.  \t\tFollow-up tests or treatment that you may not have needed. \t  Getting a false-negative result means that your test results appear normal, but there are precancer or cancerous cells. A false-negative may lead to:  \t \t\tYou may delay seeking treatment even if you have symptoms. \t    Should I be screened for cervical cancer? Talk with your provider about how often you should be screened for cervical cancer and which tests you should get. This will depend on your age and health history. If you have a cervix, it's recommended that you have your first Pap smear at age 21 and begin screening with an HPV test at age 25. You may need screening more often if you:  Had an abnormal HPV test, Pap smear, or cervical biopsy in the recent past.  Have had a diagnosis of cervical cancer. Have a weakened immune system.  Were exposed to a drug called DES (Diethylstilbestrol) before you were born. Between the years 1940-1971, DES was sometimes prescribed to prevent miscarriages.    If you are over age 65 and have had regular Pap smear screenings with normal results, your provider may tell you that you no longer need them. If you have HIV, you may need to continue screenings after age 65. You don't need cervical cancer screening if you had a total hysterectomy (surgery to remove your uterus and cervix) because of a condition that was not cancer. But if your hysterectomy was related to cervical cancer or precancer, ask your provider whether you need screening.  NIH: National Cancer Institute",

    "disease": "Cervix Disorders",
    "summary": "What is a cervix disorder? A cervix disorder is a problem with your cervix. The cervix is part of the female reproductive system. It is the lower, narrow end of the uterus (womb), which opens into the vagina (birth canal). The cervix has a small opening that expands during childbirth. It also allows menstrual blood to leave your body. You may not have any symptoms of a cervix disorder, but routine pelvic exams and a Pap smear test  can help determine if you may need treatment. Cervix disorders can include:  Cervical cancer is a cancer that starts in the cells of the cervix. Cervicitis is swelling of the cervix. An infection usually causes it, but it can also be caused by skin irritation. Treatment can help you avoid potential complications like pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Cervical incompetence (also called cervical insufficiency) can happen during pregnancy. The opening of your cervix widens too early. This may cause you to give birth too soon, or you could lose the fetus. Cervical polyps and cysts are fleshy or fluid-filled growths on your cervix. These growths are usually benign (not cancer). They are more common during your reproductive years, especially after age 20.   Who is more likely to develop cervix disorders?  You are more likely to develop a cervix disorder if:  You've had a previous cervical procedure or surgery. You've had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as chlamydia or gonorrhea.  You used a latex condom or a feminine product such as a spermicide or douche that irritated the skin of your vagina. You left something in your vagina too long, such as a diaphragm, tampon, or cervical cap, and it caused irritation. You don't consistently use a condom when you have sex, or you have multiple sex partners.    What are the symptoms of cervix disorders? You may not know that something is wrong since cervix disorders may not have any symptoms. If you have symptoms, they may vary based on the cervix disorder. Symptoms can include:  Vaginal bleeding that's not normal for you, such as bleeding between menstrual periods Pain during sex or a pelvic exam Abnormal vaginal discharge   If you are pregnant, a few signs of an incompetent cervix could include light vaginal bleeding, a feeling of pelvic pressure, or mild cramps. But you may not have any signs.   How are cervix disorders diagnosed? Even if you don't have symptoms, your health care provider may notice changes to the cells of your cervix during a pelvic exam. Your provider may look for:  Redness or inflammation (swelling) of your cervix or vaginal walls Vaginal discharge or strong odor    Your provider may perform a Pap test to look for changes in your cervix.    What are the treatments for cervix disorders? The treatment for cervix disorders depends on the cause. It might include antibiotics or stopping using a product that causes skin irritation. If you have had an incompetent cervix in the past, you might take medicine or have ultrasound imaging tests to check how your pregnancy is going.   Can cervix disorders be prevented? You can take steps to prevent some cervix disorders. This can include to:  Use a condom every time you have sex. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STIs. If you or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. Have regular pelvic exams. Get tested for STIs as needed. Avoid using personal care products that may cause skin irritation to your vagina.",

    "disease": "Cesarean Delivery",
    "summary": "What is a cesarean delivery? A cesarean delivery, also called a cesarean section or c-section, is surgery to deliver a baby. The baby is taken out through your abdomen (belly). In the United States, almost one in three babies are born this way. Some cesarean deliveries are planned. Others are emergency cesarean deliveries, which are done when unexpected problems happen during delivery.  When is a cesarean delivery needed? You may need a cesarean delivery because:  You have health problems, including infection You are carrying more than one baby Your baby is too big Your baby is in the wrong position Your baby's health is in danger Labor is not moving along as it should There are problems with your placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to your baby)   Not everyone who has had a cesarean delivery before will need another one next time. You may be able to have a vaginal birth after cesarean (VBAC). Talk to your health care provider about what is right for you.  How is a cesarean delivery done? Before the surgery, you will be given pain medicine. Depending on your circumstances, you might get:  An epidural block, which numbs the lower part of the body through an injection in the spine. A spinal block, which numbs the lower part of the body through an injection directly into the spinal fluid. General anesthesia, which makes you unconscious during the surgery. This is often used during emergency cesarean deliveries.   During the surgery, the surgeon will:  Make a cut in your abdomen and uterus. The cut is usually horizontal, but in some cases it may be vertical. Open the amniotic sac and take out your baby. Cut the umbilical cord and the placenta. Close the uterus and abdomen with stitches that will later dissolve.   What are the risks of a cesarean delivery? A cesarean delivery is relatively safe for you and your baby. But it is still a major surgery, and it carries risks. They may include:  Infection Blood loss Blood clots in the legs, pelvic organs, or lungs Injury to surrounding structures, such as the bowel or bladder A reaction to the medicines or anesthesia used   Some of these risks do also apply to a vaginal birth. But it does take longer to recover from a cesarean delivery than from a vaginal birth. And having a cesarean delivery can raise the risk of having difficulties with future pregnancies. The more cesarean deliveries you have, the more the risk goes up.   NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development",

Chagas disease is common in Latin America, especially in poor, rural areas. It can also be found in the United States, most often in people who were infected before they moved to the U.S.  What causes Chagas disease? Chagas disease is caused by the Trypanosoma cruzi  parasite. It is usually spread by infected blood-sucking bugs called triatomine bugs. They are also known as \"kissing bugs\" because they often bite people's faces. When one of these bugs bites you, it leaves behind infected waste. You can become infected if you rub the waste in your eyes or nose, the bite wound, or a cut.   Chagas disease can also spread through contaminated food, a blood transfusion, a donated organ, or from the pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy.  Who is more likely to develop Chagas disease? Kissing bugs can be found throughout the Americas, but they are more common in certain areas. The people who are most at risk for Chagas disease: Live in rural areas of Latin America Have seen the bugs, especially in those areas Have stayed in a house with a thatched roof or with walls that have cracks or crevices   What are the symptoms of Chagas disease? In the beginning, there may be no symptoms. Some people do get mild symptoms, such as: Fever Fatigue Body aches Headache Loss of appetite Diarrhea Vomiting A rash A swollen eyelid   These early symptoms usually go away. However, if you don't treat the infection, it stays in your body. Later, it can cause serious intestinal and heart problems such as: An  serious arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) that can cause sudden death An enlarged heart that doesn't pump blood well Problems with digestion and bowel movements An increased chance of having a stroke   How is Chagas disease diagnosed? To find out if you have Chagas disease, your health care provider:  Will do a physical exam Will take your medical history, including asking about your symptoms and where you have lived and traveled Will run a blood test for Chagas disease May run tests to see whether the disease has affected your intestines and heart    What are the treatments for Chagas disease?  Medicines can kill the parasite, especially early on. You can also treat related problems. For example, a pacemaker can help with some heart complications.  Can Chagas disease be prevented? There are no vaccines or medicines to prevent Chagas disease. If you travel to areas where it occurs, you are at higher risk if you sleep outdoors or are staying in poor housing conditions.

    "disease": "Childbirth",
    "summary": "What is childbirth? Childbirth is the process of giving birth to a baby. It includes labor and delivery of the fetus and the placenta. The placenta is the organ that supplies food and oxygen through the umbilical cord to your fetus during pregnancy.   A full-term pregnancy is 40 weeks. Labor usually begins between 37 and 42 weeks of pregnancy. It is how your body prepares to give birth to your baby. Preterm labor can start before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy. It can lead to premature birth. Premature babies may face serious health risks.  How do I know if I'm going into labor? Signs that you might be going into labor include:  Regular contractions start to come closer together Leaking fluid or bleeding from the vagina Low, dull backache Abdominal (belly) cramps   The signs of labor, when labor starts, and the time it takes to deliver your baby can vary with each pregnancy. Call your health care provider if you have any signs of labor, even if it is before your due date.   What are the stages of labor? Labor happens in three stages.   The first stage begins with contractions. This stage could last for hours or days. It continues until your cervix has become thinner and dilated (stretched) to about 4 inches wide to allow your baby to pass through. The second stage is when you begin to push downward. Crowning is when your baby's scalp comes into view. Shortly afterward, your baby is born.  The third stage is when you deliver the placenta, and your provider cuts the umbilical cord.    Sometimes, mothers need to have labor induced. Medicines or other methods are used to start labor. This is usually only done when the due date has passed or if a problem with the pregnancy risks the health of the mother or the fetus.  Mothers and their babies are closely monitored during labor and delivery. Delivery can occur either vaginally through the birth canal, or if there are complications, the delivery may be done surgically by a Cesarean section. This is when the baby is taken out through your abdomen (belly) and uterus.    What are the options for pain relief during childbirth? The amount of pain during childbirth can vary based on the size and position of the baby, your level of comfort with the process, and the strength of your contractions.   Options for pain relief during labor and delivery may include:   Medicines may reduce the pain, but they don't stop it completely. Natural methods ease pain without taking medicines. A few examples include using relaxation techniques, a birthing ball, massage, or taking a bath or shower. Combination of medicines and natural methods.    Discuss your options, risks, and benefits of pain relief during labor and delivery with your provider before your due date.   NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development",

Some of the more common childbirth problems include: Preterm (premature) labor, when your labor starts before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy Premature rupture of membranes (PROM), when your water breaks too early. If labor does not start soon afterwards, this can raise the risk of infection. Problems with the placenta, such as the placenta covering the cervix, separating from the uterus before birth, or being attached too firmly to the uterus Labor that does not progress, meaning that labor is stalled. This can happen when \t\t \t\t\tYour contractions weaken \t\t\tYour cervix does not dilate (open) enough or is taking too long to dilate \t\t\tThe baby is not in the right position \t\t\tThe baby is too big or your pelvis is too small for the baby to move through the birth canal \t\t \t\t Abnormal heart rate of the baby. Often, an abnormal heart rate is not a problem. But if the heart rate gets very fast or very slow, it can be a sign that your baby is not getting enough oxygen or that there are other problems. Problems with the umbilical cord, such as the cord getting caught on the baby's arm, leg, or neck. It's also a problem if cord comes out before the baby does. Problems with the position of the baby, such as breech, in which the baby is going to come out feet first Shoulder dystocia, when the baby's head comes out, but the shoulder gets stuck Perinatal asphyxia, which happens when the baby does not get enough oxygen in the uterus, during labor or delivery, or just after birth Perineal tears, tearing of your vagina and the surrounding tissues Excessive bleeding, which can happen when the delivery causes tears to the uterus or if you are not able to deliver the placenta after you give birth to the baby Post-term pregnancy, when your pregnancy lasts more than 42 weeks  If you have problems in childbirth, your health care provider may need to give you medicines to induce or speed up labor, use tools to help guide the baby out of the birth canal, or deliver the baby by Cesarean section.

    "disease": "Childhood Leukemia",
    "summary": "What is leukemia? Leukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job: White blood cells help your body fight infection Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding   When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.  What are the types of leukemia in children? There are different types of leukemia. Some types are acute (fast growing). They usually get worse quickly if they are not treated. Most childhood leukemias are acute: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), which is the most common type of leukemia in children and the most common cancer in children. In ALL, the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell.  Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which happens when bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets.   Other types of leukemia are chronic (slow growing). They usually get worse over a longer period of time. They are rare in children: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in which the bone marrow makes abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). It is more common in teens than children. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), in which the bone marrow makes abnormal granulocytes (a type of white blood cell). It is very rare in children.   There are some other rare types of leukemia in children, including juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML).   What causes leukemia in children? Leukemia happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown. However, there are certain factors that raise the risk of childhood leukemia.  Who is at risk for leukemia in children? The factors that raise the risk of childhood leukemia include: Having a brother or sister, especially a twin, with leukemia Past treatment with chemotherapy Exposure to radiation, including radiation therapy Having certain genetic conditions, such as  \t \tAtaxia telangiectasia \tDown syndrome \tFanconi anemia \tLi-Fraumeni syndrome \tNeurofibromatosis type 1 \t    There are other factors that may raise the risk of getting one or more of the specific types of childhood leukemia.   What are the symptoms of leukemia in children? Some of the symptoms of leukemia may include: Feeling tired Fever or night sweats Easy bruising or bleeding Weight loss or loss of appetite Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding.   Other leukemia symptoms can be different from type to type. Chronic leukemia may not cause symptoms at first.  How is leukemia in children diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose leukemia: A physical exam A medical history Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) Bone marrow tests. There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing. Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes   Once there is a diagnosis of leukemia, other tests may be done to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and a lumbar puncture, which is a procedure to collect and test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  What are the treatments for leukemia in children? The treatments for leukemia depend on which type it is, how severe the leukemia is, the child's age, and other factors. Possible treatments might include: chemotherapy radiation therapy Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells   Treatment for childhood leukemia is often successful. But the treatments can cause complications right away or later in life. Children who survived leukemia will need follow-up care the rest of their lives to watch for and treat any complications they may have.  NIH: National Cancer Institute",

    "disease": "Childhood Vaccines",
    "summary": "What are vaccines? Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach the immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria.  Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make your child sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ.  These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps the body fight off the germs. Your child's immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.  Why do I need to vaccinate my child? Babies are born with immune systems that can fight most germs, but there are some serious diseases they can't handle. That's why they need vaccines to strengthen their immune system.  These diseases once killed or harmed many infants, children, and adults. But now with vaccines, your child can get immunity from these diseases without having to get sick. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would.    Vaccinating your child also protects others. Normally, germs can travel quickly through a community and make a lot of people sick. If enough people get sick, it can lead to an outbreak. But when enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, it's harder for that disease to spread to others. The entire community is less likely to get the disease. This is called \"community immunity.\"  Community immunity is especially important for the people who can't get certain vaccines. For example, they may not be able to get a vaccine because they have weakened immune systems. Others may be allergic to certain vaccine ingredients. And newborn babies are too young to get some vaccines. Community immunity can help to protect them all.  Are vaccines safe for children? Vaccines are safe. They must go through extensive safety testing and evaluation before they are approved in the United States.  Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and autism.  Can vaccines overload my child's immune system? No, vaccines do not overload the immune system. Every day, a healthy child's immune system successfully fights off thousands of germs. When your child gets vaccines, they are getting weakened or dead germs. So even if they get several vaccines in one day, they are being exposed to a tiny amount of germs compared to what they encounter every day in their environment.  When do I need to vaccinate my child? Your child will get vaccines during well-child visits. They will be given according to the vaccine schedule. This schedule lists which vaccines are recommended for children. It includes who should get the vaccines, how many doses they need, and at what age they should get them. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes the vaccine schedule.  Following the vaccine schedule allows your child to get protection from the diseases at exactly the right time. It gives their body the chance to build up immunity before being exposed to these very serious diseases.",

    "summary": "What is chlamydia? Chlamydia is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI). It is caused by bacteria called Chlamydia trachomatis. Anyone can get chlamydia. It often doesn't cause symptoms, so people may not know that they have it. Antibiotics can cure it. But if it's not treated, chlamydia can cause serious health problems.   How is chlamydia spread? You can get chlamydia during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with someone who has chlamydia. Chlamydia can also be passed to the baby during  childbirth.  If you've had chlamydia and were treated in the past, you can get re-infected if you have unprotected sex with someone who has it.  Who is more likely to get chlamydia? Chlamydia is more common in young people, especially young women. You are more likely to get infected with chlamydia if you don't consistently use a condom or if you have multiple partners.  What are the symptoms of chlamydia? Chlamydia doesn't usually cause any symptoms. So you may not realize that you have it. But even if you don't have symptoms, you can still pass the infection to others.   If you do have symptoms, they may not appear until several weeks after you have sex with someone who has chlamydia.  Symptoms in women include: Abnormal vaginal discharge, which may have a strong smell A burning sensation when urinating   If the infection spreads, you might get lower abdominal (belly) pain, pain during sex, nausea, and fever.  Symptoms in men include: Discharge from your penis A burning sensation when urinating (peeing) Pain and swelling in one or both testicles (although this is less common)   If the chlamydia infects the rectum (in men or women), it can cause rectal pain, discharge, and bleeding.  How is chlamydia diagnosed? There are lab tests to diagnose chlamydia. Your health care provider may ask you to provide a urine sample. Or your provider may use (or ask you to use) a cotton swab to get a sample from your vagina to test for chlamydia.    Who should be tested for chlamydia? You should go to your provider for a test if you have symptoms of chlamydia or if you have a partner who has an STI. If you are pregnant, you should get a test when you go to your first prenatal visit.  People at higher risk should get checked for chlamydia every year: Sexually active women 25 and younger Older women who have new or multiple sex partners or a sex partner who has an STI Men who have sex with men (MSM)   What other problems can chlamydia cause?  In women, an untreated infection can spread to your uterus and fallopian tubes, causing pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). PID can cause permanent damage to your reproductive system. This can lead to long-term pelvic pain, infertility, and ectopic pregnancy. Women who have had chlamydia infections more than once are at higher risk of serious reproductive health complications.  Men often don't have health problems from chlamydia. Sometimes it can infect the epididymis (the tube that carries sperm). This can cause pain, fever, and, rarely, infertility.  Both men and women can develop reactive arthritis because of a chlamydia infection. Reactive arthritis is a type of arthritis that happens as a \"reaction\" to an infection in the body.  Babies born to infected mothers can get eye infections and pneumonia from chlamydia. It may also make it more likely for your baby to be born too early.  Untreated chlamydia may also increase your chances of getting or giving HIV.  What are the treatments for chlamydia? Antibiotics will cure the infection. You may get a one-time dose of the antibiotics, or you may need to take medicine every day for 7 days. It is important to take all the medicine that your provider prescribed for you. Antibiotics cannot repair any permanent damage that the disease has caused.  To prevent spreading the disease to your partner, you should not have sex until the infection has cleared up. If you got a one-time dose of antibiotics, you should wait 7 days after taking the medicine to have sex again. If you have to take medicine every day for 7 days, you should not have sex again until you have finished taking all of the doses of your medicine.  It is common to get a repeat infection, so you need to get tested again about three months after treatment.  Can chlamydia be prevented? The only sure way to prevent chlamydia is to not have vaginal, anal, or oral sex.  Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading chlamydia. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

You may get it if you travel to parts of the world with poor water and sewage treatment. Outbreaks can also happen after disasters. The disease is not likely to spread directly from person to person.  Cholera infections are often mild. Some people don't have any symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they usually start 2 to 3 days after infection. The most common symptom is watery diarrhea.   In some cases, the infection can be severe, causing  lots of watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. Because you quickly lose body fluids, you are at risk for dehydration and shock. Without treatment, you could die within hours. If you think that you might have cholera, you should get medical care right away.  Doctors diagnose cholera with a stool sample or rectal swab. Treatment is the replacement of the fluid and salts that you lost through the diarrhea. This is usually with a rehydration solution that you drink. People with severe cases may need an I.V. to replace the fluids. Some of them may also need antibiotics. Most people who get fluid replacement right away will recover.   There are vaccines to prevent cholera. One of them is available for adults in the U.S. Very few Americans need it, because most people do not visit areas that have an active cholera outbreak.   There are also simple steps you can take to help to prevent cholera infection:  Use only bottled or purified water for drinking, washing dishes, making ice cubes, and brushing your teeth If you do use tap water, boil it or use iodine tablets Wash your hands often with soap and clean water Make sure that the cooked food you eat is fully cooked and served hot Avoid unwashed or unpeeled raw fruits and vegetables   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

    "disease": "Cholesterol",
    "summary": "What is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to make hormones, vitamin D, and substances that help you digest foods. Your body makes all the cholesterol it needs. Cholesterol is also found in foods from animal sources, such as egg yolks, meat, and cheese.  If you have too much cholesterol in your blood, it can combine with other substances in the blood to form plaque. Plaque sticks to the walls of your arteries. This buildup of plaque is known as atherosclerosis. It can lead to coronary artery disease, a condition in which your coronary arteries become narrow or even blocked.   What are HDL, LDL, and VLDL? HDL, LDL, and VLDL are lipoproteins. They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein. The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. Different types of lipoproteins have different purposes: HDL stands for high-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"good\" cholesterol because it helps your body get rid of cholesterol.  It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body. LDL stands for low-density lipoprotein. It is sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. VLDL stands for very low-density lipoprotein. Some people also call VLDL a \"bad\" cholesterol because it too contributes to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. But VLDL and LDL are different; VLDL mainly carries triglycerides and LDL mainly carries cholesterol.   What causes high cholesterol? The most common cause of high cholesterol is an unhealthy lifestyle. This can include: Unhealthy eating habits, such as eating lots of saturated fats. These fats are found in red meats, full-fat dairy products, chocolate, some baked goods, and many deep-fried and processed foods.  Eating too much saturated fat can raise your LDL (bad) cholesterol. Lack of physical activity, with lots of sitting and little exercise. This lowers your HDL (good) cholesterol. Smoking, which lowers HDL cholesterol, especially in women. It also raises your LDL cholesterol. Stress, which may raise levels of certain hormones such as corticosteroids. These can cause your body to make more cholesterol. Drinking too much alcohol, which can raise your total cholesterol level.   Genetics may also cause people to have high cholesterol. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition that causes very high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Other medical conditions and certain medicines may also raise LDL cholesterol levels or lower HDL cholesterol levels.  What can raise my risk of high cholesterol? A variety of things can raise your risk of high cholesterol: Age. Your cholesterol levels tend to rise as you get older. Even though it is less common, younger people, including children and teens, can also have high cholesterol. Sex. Between ages 20 and 39, men have a greater risk of high total cholesterol than women. But after menopause, a woman's risk goes up. This happens because menopause lowers levels of female hormones that may protect against high blood cholesterol. Family history. High blood cholesterol can run in families. Other health conditions. Conditions such as diabetes, chronic kidney disease, HIV, and lupus can raise your risk of high cholesterol. Medicines. Certain medicines can raise your level of LDL cholesterol or lower your level of HDL cholesterol, including:      Steroids   Some chemotherapy medicines   Medicines taken after an organ transplant   Medicines for certain heart conditions   Certain acne medicines     Race or ethnicity. People from certain racial or ethnic groups may have an increased risk of high cholesterol. For example, Asian Americans are more likely to have high levels of LDL cholesterol than other groups. And non-Hispanic White people are more likely than other groups to have high levels of total cholesterol. Weight. Being overweight or having obesity raises your cholesterol level.   What other health problems can high cholesterol cause? Undiagnosed or untreated high blood cholesterol can lead to serious health problems:  If you have large deposits of plaque in your arteries, an area of plaque can rupture (break open). This can cause a blood clot to form on the surface of the plaque. If the clot becomes large enough, it can mostly or completely block blood flow in a coronary artery. If the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your heart muscle is reduced or blocked, it can cause angina (chest pain) or a heart attack. Plaque also can build up in other arteries in your body, including the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your brain and limbs. This can lead to problems such as carotid artery disease, stroke, and peripheral arterial disease.   How is high cholesterol diagnosed? There are usually no signs or symptoms that you have high cholesterol. A blood test can measure your cholesterol levels. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history.  The general recommendations are:  For people who are age 19 or younger:  The first test should be between ages 9 to 11 Children should have the test again every 5 years Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke   For people who are ages 20 to 65:  Younger adults should have the test every 5 years Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years   For people over age 65:  They should be tested every year   How can I lower my cholesterol?  You can lower your cholesterol through heart-healthy lifestyle changes. They include a heart-healthy eating plan, weight management, and regular physical activity.  If the lifestyle changes alone do not lower your cholesterol enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering medicines available, including statins. If you take medicines to lower your cholesterol, you still should continue with the lifestyle changes.  Some people with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) may receive a treatment called lipoprotein apheresis. This treatment uses a filtering machine to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood. Then the machine returns the rest of the blood back to the person.  NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "summary": "What is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly.  But if you have too much of it in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk of coronary artery disease and other heart diseases.   How do you measure cholesterol levels? A blood test called a lipoprotein or lipid panel can measure your cholesterol levels. Before the test, you'll need to fast (not eat or drink anything but water) for 9 to 12 hours. The test gives information about your: Total cholesterol. This is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood. It includes both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. LDL cholesterol. LDL is often called \"bad\" cholesterol because it is the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockage in the arteries. HDL cholesterol. HDL is often called \"good\" cholesterol because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. Non-HDL. This number is your total cholesterol minus your HDL. Your non-HDL includes LDL and other types of cholesterol such as VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein). Triglycerides. This is another type of fat in your blood that can raise the risk of heart disease, especially in women.   What do my cholesterol numbers mean? Cholesterol numbers are measured in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). Talk with your healthcare provider about what your cholesterol numbers should be. The numbers that are best for you may depend on your age, race, blood pressure, weight, family history, and more. However, here are some general guidelines showing the desirable levels (levels that are healthy for most people):  Anyone age 19 or younger:                            Type of Cholesterol             Healthy Level                                         Total Cholesterol             Less than 170 mg/dL                                      Non-HDL             Less than 120 mg/dL                                      LDL             Less than 110 mg/dL                                      HDL             More than 45 mg/dL                         Men age 20 or older:                            Type of Cholesterol             Healthy Level                                         Total Cholesterol             Less than 200 mg/dL                                      Non-HDL             Less than 130 mg/dL                                      LDL             Less than 100 mg/dL                                      HDL             Greater than or equal to 60 mg/dL is best. Levels less than 40 mg/dL are considered low.                         Women age 20 or older:                            Type of Cholesterol             Healthy Level                                                 Total Cholesterol             Less than 200 mg/dL                                      Non-HDL             Less than 130 mg/dL                                      LDL             Less than 100 mg/dL                                      HDL             Greater than or equal to 60 mg/dL is best. Levels less than 50 mg/dL are considered low.                        Triglycerides are not a type of cholesterol, but they are also measured in this test. A normal triglyceride level is below 150 mg/dL. You might need treatment if you have triglyceride levels that are borderline high (150-199 mg/dL) or high (200 mg/dL or more).  How often should I get a cholesterol test? When and how often you should get a cholesterol test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are:  For people who are age 19 or younger:  The first test should be between ages 9 to 11 Children should have the test again every 5 years Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke   For people who are ages 20 to 65:  Younger adults should have the test every 5 years Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years   For people older than 65::  They should be tested every year    What affects my cholesterol levels? Many factors can affect your cholesterol levels. Some of them are things you can change:  Diet. Saturated fat and cholesterol in the food you eat make your blood cholesterol level rise. Saturated fat is the main problem, but cholesterol in foods also matters. Reducing the amount of saturated fat in your diet helps lower your blood cholesterol level. Foods that have high levels of saturated fats include red meats, full-fat dairy products, chocolate, some baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods. Weight. Being overweight or having obesity are risk factors for heart disease. They also tend to increase your cholesterol Lack of physical activity. Not being physically active is a risk factor for heart disease. Smoking. Cigarette smoking lowers your HDL cholesterol. Since HDL helps to remove cholesterol from your arteries, having a lower HDL level can contribute to a higher cholesterol level.     Some factors that you cannot change can also affect cholesterol levels, such as:  Age. Your cholesterol levels tend to rise as you get older. Even though it is less common, younger people, including children and teens, can also have high cholesterol. Sex. Between ages 20 and 39, men have a greater risk of high total cholesterol than women. But after menopause, a woman's risk goes up. This happens because menopause lowers levels of female hormones that may protect against high blood cholesterol. Family history. Your genes partly determine how much cholesterol your body makes. High cholesterol can run in families. Race or ethnicity. People from certain racial or ethnic groups may have an increased risk of high cholesterol. For example, Asian Americans are more likely to have high levels of LDL cholesterol than other groups. And non-Hispanic White people are more likely than other groups to have high levels of total cholesterol.     How can I lower my cholesterol?

But if you have too much of it in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases.  Cholesterol is made by your liver. It travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type of lipoprotein, LDL, is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL, is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body.  What are the treatments for high cholesterol? If you have high cholesterol, lifestyle changes can help you lower your cholesterol levels. But sometimes the lifestyle changes are not enough, and you need to take cholesterol medicines. But you should still continue with the lifestyle changes even though you are taking medicines.   Who needs cholesterol medicines? Your health care provider may prescribe cholesterol medicines for you if: You have already had a heart attack or stroke, or you have peripheral arterial disease Your LDL (bad) cholesterol level is 190 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have diabetes, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher You are 40-75 years old, you have a high risk of developing heart disease or stroke, and your LDL cholesterol level is 70 mg/dL or higher   What are the different types of cholesterol medicines? There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including:  Statins. They reduce the amount of cholesterol made in the liver. They also increase your liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol that is already in the blood. Statins are the most common medicines used to treat high cholesterol. Bile acid sequestrants.  They keep bile acids, which digest fats and oils, from being absorbed into the body.  But your body needs bile acids, so your liver will make more of them. It makes them by breaking down LDL cholesterol, so this helps lower your LDL cholesterol. Your provider may prescribe these medicines if you cannot take statins or if statins alone are not lowering your cholesterol enough. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors.  They block how cholesterol is absorbed into the body. They are also used if you cannot take statins or if statins alone are not lowering your cholesterol enough. Nicotinic acid (niacin).  It is a type of B vitamin. It reduces the amount of fats made by your liver, so it lowers your LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Niacin also raises HDL cholesterol. Even though you can buy niacin without a prescription, you should talk to your provider before taking it to lower your cholesterol. High doses of niacin can cause serious side effects. PCSK9 inhibitors.  These are medicines that you inject under your skin. They block a protein called PCSK9. This helps your liver remove and clear LDL cholesterol from your blood. Your provider may prescribe a PCSK9 inhibitor and a statin if you are at high risk of complications like heart attack or stroke, or if you have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). FH is an inherited disorder that causes very high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Fibrates.  They lower triglycerides in several complex ways, including reducing the amount of triglycerides made by the liver. They may also help increase HDL cholesterol and may lower LDL levels a bit. If you take them with statins, it might increase the risk of side effects. Combination medicines. They include more than one type of cholesterol-lowering medicine. There are also combination medicines that can treat both high blood pressure and cholesterol.   There are also a few other cholesterol medicines (lomitapide and mipomersen) that are only for people who have FH.   How does my health care provider decide which cholesterol medicine I should take? When deciding which medicine you should take and which dose you need, your provider will consider: Your cholesterol levels. Your risk for heart disease and stroke. Your age. Any other health problems you have. Possible side effects of the medicines. Higher doses are more likely to cause side effects, especially over time.   Medicines can help control your cholesterol, but they don't cure it. You need to keep taking your medicines and get regular cholesterol checks to make sure that your cholesterol levels are in a healthy range.",

    "disease": "Chronic Bronchitis",
    "summary": "What is chronic bronchitis?  Chronic bronchitis is a type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. The other main type of COPD is emphysema. Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person. Chronic bronchitis is inflammation (swelling) and irritation of the bronchial tubes. These tubes are the airways that carry air to and from the air sacs in your lungs. The irritation of the tubes causes mucus to build up. This mucus and the swelling of the tubes make it harder for your lungs to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of your body.  What causes chronic bronchitis? The cause of chronic bronchitis is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause chronic bronchitis, especially if you inhale them.  Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to chronic bronchitis. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace. Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing chronic bronchitis.  Who is at risk for chronic bronchitis? The risk factors for chronic bronchitis include: Smoking. This the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have chronic bronchitis smoke or used to smoke.  Long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace. Age. Most people who have chronic bronchitis are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.  Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get chronic bronchitis are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD.   What are the symptoms of chronic bronchitis? At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include: Frequent coughing or a cough that produces a lot mucus Wheezing A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity Tightness in your chest  Some people with chronic bronchitis get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. In severe cases, chronic bronchitis can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs.  How is chronic bronchitis diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A family history Various tests, such as lung function tests, a chest x-ray or CT scan, and blood tests   What are the treatments for chronic bronchitis? There is no cure for chronic bronchitis. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include: Lifestyle changes, such as \t \t\tQuitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat chronic bronchitis. \t\tAvoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants \t\tAsk your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness. \t  Medicines, such as \t \t\tBronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation. \t\tVaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with chronic bronchitis are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases. \t\tAntibiotics if you get a bacterial or viral lung infection \t  Oxygen therapy, if you have severe chronic bronchitis and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times. Pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include  \t \t\tAn exercise program \t\tDisease management training \t\tNutritional counseling \t\tPsychological counseling \t A lung transplant, as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines\t   If you have chronic bronchitis, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever.  Can chronic bronchitis be prevented? Since smoking causes most cases of chronic bronchitis, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts.   NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

They also keep the body's chemicals balanced, help control blood pressure, and make hormones.  Chronic kidney disease (CKD) means that your kidneys are damaged and can't filter blood as they should. This damage can cause wastes to build up in your body. It can also cause other problems that can harm your health. Diabetes and high blood pressure are the most common causes of CKD.  The kidney damage occurs slowly over many years. Many people don't have any symptoms until their kidney disease is very advanced. Blood and urine tests are the only way to know if you have kidney disease.   Treatments cannot cure kidney disease, but they may slow kidney disease. They include medicines to lower blood pressure, control blood sugar, and lower cholesterol. CKD may still get worse over time. Sometimes it can lead to kidney failure.

    "disease": "Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia",
    "summary": "What is leukemia? Leukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job: White blood cells help your body fight infection Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding  When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.  What is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)?  Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a type of chronic leukemia. \"Chronic\" means that the leukemia usually gets worse slowly. In CLL, the bone marrow makes abnormal lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). When the abnormal cells crowd out the healthy cells, it can lead to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. The abnormal cells can also spread outside the blood to other parts of the body. CLL is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults. It often occurs during or after middle age. It is rare in children.  What causes chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)? CLL happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown, so it's hard to predict who might get CLL. There are a few factors that might raise your risk.  Who is at risk for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)? It is hard to predict who will get CLL. There are a few factors that could raise your risk: Age - your risk goes up as you get older. Most people who are diagnosed with CLL are over 50. Family history of CLL and other blood and bone marrow diseases Racial/ethnic group - CLL is more common in whites than in people from other racial or ethnic groups Exposure to certain chemicals, including Agent Orange, a chemical that was used in the Vietnam War   What are the symptoms of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)? In the beginning, CLL does not cause any symptoms. Later, you can have symptoms such as: Swollen lymph nodes - you may notice them as painless lumps in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin Weakness or feeling tired Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs Fever and infection Easy bruising or bleeding Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding. Weight loss for no known reason Drenching night sweats       How is chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose CLL: A physical exam A medical history Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) with differential and blood chemistry tests. Blood chemistry tests measure different substances in the blood, including electrolytes, fats, proteins, glucose (sugar), and enzymes. Specific blood chemistry tests include a basic metabolic panel (BMP), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), kidney function tests, liver function tests, and an electrolyte panel. Flow cytometry tests, which check for leukemia cells and identify which type of leukemia it is. The tests can be done on blood, bone marrow, or other tissue.  Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes  If you are diagnosed with CLL, you may have additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and bone marrow tests.  What are the treatments for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)? Treatments for CLL include:     Watchful waiting, which means that you don't get treatment right away. Your health care provider regularly checks to see if your signs or symptoms appear or change. Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Immunotherapy Chemotherapy with bone marrow or stem cell transplant  The goals of treatment are to slow the growth of the leukemia cells and to give you long periods of remission. Remission means that the signs and symptoms of cancer are reduced or have disappeared. The CLL may come back after remission, and you may need more treatment.  NIH: National Cancer Institute",

Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a type of chronic leukemia. \"Chronic\" means that the leukemia usually gets worse slowly. In CML, the bone marrow makes abnormal granulocytes (a type of white blood cell). These abnormal cells are also called blasts. When the abnormal cells crowd out the healthy cells, it can lead to infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. The abnormal cells can also spread outside the blood to other parts of the body.  CML usually occurs in adults during or after middle age. It is rare in children.  What causes chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)? Most people with CML have a genetic change called the Philadelphia chromosome. It's called that because researchers in Philadelphia discovered it. People normally have 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell. These chromosomes contain your DNA (genetic material). In CML, part of the DNA from one chromosome moves to another chromosome. It combines with some DNA there, which creates a new gene called BCR-ABL. This gene causes your bone marrow to make an abnormal protein. This protein allows the leukemia cells to grow out of control.  The Philadelphia chromosome isn't passed from parent to child. It happens during your lifetime. The cause is unknown.  Who is at risk for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)? It is hard to predict who will get CML. There are a few factors that could raise your risk: Age - your risk goes up as you get older CML is slightly more common in men Exposure to high-dose radiation   What are the symptoms of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)? Sometimes CML does not cause symptoms.

Specific blood chemistry tests include a basic metabolic panel (BMP), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), kidney function tests, liver function tests, and an electrolyte panel. Bone marrow tests. There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing. Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes, including tests to look for the Philadelphia chromosome   If you are diagnosed with CML, you may have additional tests such as imaging tests to see whether the cancer has spread.  What are the phases of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)? CML has three phases. The phases are based on how much the CML has grown or spread: Chronic phase, where less than 10% of cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells (leukemia cells). Most people are diagnosed in this phase, and many do not have symptoms. Standard treatment usually helps in this phase. Accelerated phase, 10% to 19% of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells. In this phase, people often have symptoms and standard treatment may not be as effective as in the chronic phase. Blastic phase, where 20% or more of the cells in the blood or bone marrow are blast cells. The blast cells have spread to other tissues and organs. If you have tiredness, fever, and an enlarged spleen during the blastic phase, it is called a blast crisis. This phase is harder to treat.   What are the treatments for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML)? There are several different treatments for CML: Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. For CML, the drugs are tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). They block tyrosine kinase, which is an enzyme that causes your bone marrow to make too many blasts. Chemotherapy Immunotherapy High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). DLI is a treatment that may be used after a stem cell transplant. It involves giving you an infusion (into your bloodstream) of healthy lymphocytes from the stem cell transplant donor. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell. These donor lymphocytes may kill the remaining cancer cells. Surgery to remove the spleen (splenectomy)   Which treatments you get will depend on which phase you are in, your age, your overall health, and other factors. When the signs and symptoms of CML are reduced or have disappeared, it is called remission. The CML may come back after remission, and you may need more treatment.  NIH: National Cancer Institute",

    "disease": "Chronic Pain",
    "summary": "What is chronic pain? Pain is a signal from your nervous system that something may be wrong. It is an unpleasant feeling, such as a prick, tingle, sting, burn, or ache. Pain may be sharp or dull. You may feel pain in one area of your body or all over. Each person feels pain differently, even if the reason for the pain is the same. Pain might be acute or chronic. The type of pain is based on how long and how often you have pain. Acute pain starts suddenly and goes away when the cause is treated or healed. This pain lets you know that you may be injured or have a problem you need to take care of. Chronic pain lasts longer than three months or the time in which you should have healed.  If you have chronic pain, it can occur most days or every day and may last for weeks, months, or even years. It can affect all aspects of daily life, including your mood and relationships. Treatment may not get rid of chronic pain, but it can help with your symptoms.  What causes chronic pain? Sometimes, acute pain can become chronic pain. The original cause may have been an injury or infection, or you may have an ongoing cause of pain, such as arthritis or cancer. In some cases, there is no clear cause. Environmental factors and psychological factors such as mood and stress can make chronic pain worse.  What are the symptoms of chronic pain? Since people feel pain in different ways, two people could have the same issue, but each may have different symptoms. Chronic pain can occur anywhere in your body and may cause other symptoms such as fatigue, mood changes, or difficulty sleeping. If you have depression or stress, it may make chronic pain worse.   Who is more likely to get chronic pain? Many older adults have chronic pain. Women also report having more chronic pain than men, and they are at a greater risk for many pain conditions. Some people have two or more chronic pain conditions. You may be more likely to have chronic pain if you have certain medical conditions such as:  Headaches or migraines Cancer Fibromyalgia Arthritis Nerve damage Back problems   How is chronic pain diagnosed? Chronic pain lasts three months or longer or when pain continues after your body has healed. If the cause of your pain is unknown, your health care provider may:  Ask you about your medical history Ask you to describe the pain and how it affects your life Do a physical exam Order blood tests or other medical tests    What are the treatments for chronic pain? Chronic pain is not always curable, but treatments can help. Treatments may include medicines, including pain relievers. There are also non-drug treatments, such as acupuncture, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery.  Depending on the cause of your pain and your symptoms, your provider may also recommend lifestyle changes which may include suggestions for:  Improving mental health Managing stress Getting to and staying at a healthy weight Adding low-impact exercise",

    "summary": "What is circumcision? Circumcision is a surgical procedure to remove the foreskin from the penis. The foreskin is the loose skin that covers the tip of the penis. In the United States, circumcision is often done before a new baby leaves the hospital.   What should I consider when deciding whether to have my baby circumcised? As parents, it is your decision whether to have your baby circumcised. When making your decision, you should consider your own religious, cultural, and personal preferences, as well as the medical benefits and risks. You can discuss these with your baby's health care provider before you make a decision.  What are the medical benefits of circumcision? The possible medical benefits of circumcision include:  A lower risk of HIV and some other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A slightly lower risk of urinary tract infections (UTIs) during the first year of life and penile cancer later in life. However, these conditions are rare in all males (circumcised or not). Prevention of certain penile problems, such as foreskin infections and phimosis, a condition in which the foreskin can't be retracted (pulled back). Easier hygiene.   What are the risks of circumcision? The risks of circumcision include:   A low risk of bleeding, infection, or scarring. A very low risk of having too much or not enough skin cut off. Pain. You can ask the health care provider to put a numbing medicine on your baby's penis to lessen the pain.    These risks are higher when circumcision is performed on older babies, boys, and men.  What else do I need to know about circumcision? Premature babies and babies born with health problems should not be circumcised until they are healthy.  If have your baby circumcised, ask their provider how to care for the penis as it heals.  If your baby does not get circumcised, their provider can teach you how to keep your baby's penis clean. It's important to know that a newborn's foreskin may not retract completely. Over time, it retracts on its own.",

    "summary": "Where are germs found? Germs are a part of everyday life. Some of them are helpful, but others are harmful and cause disease. They can be found everywhere - in our air, soil, and water. They are on our skin and in our bodies. Germs are also on the surfaces and objects that we touch.  Sometimes those germs can spread to you and make you sick. For example, there could be germs on a tv remote. You could get infected with the germs if you touch the remote and then rub your eyes or nose or eat with your hands.  How can I avoid getting germs from surfaces and objects? To avoid becoming infected by germs from surfaces and objects, it is important to wash your hands often. But you can't wash your hands every time you touch something. So it's also important to regularly clean and disinfect surfaces and objects.  What is the difference between cleaning, sanitizing, and disinfecting? Some people think that disinfecting is same thing as cleaning or sanitizing. But they are actually different:  Cleaning removes dirt, dust, crumbs, and germs from surfaces or objects. When you clean, you will likely use soap (or detergent) and water to physically clean off the surfaces and objects. This may not necessarily kill the germs. But since you removed some of them, there are fewer germs that could spread infection to you. Disinfecting uses chemicals (disinfectants) to kill germs on surfaces and objects. Some common disinfectants are bleach and alcohol solutions. You usually need to leave the disinfectant on the surfaces and objects for a certain period of time to kill the germs. Disinfecting does not necessarily clean dirty surfaces or remove germs.  Sanitizing could be done by either cleaning, disinfecting, or both. Sanitizing means that you are lowering the number of germs to a safe level. What is considered a safe level depends on public health standards or requirements at a workplace, school, etc. For example, there are sanitizing procedures for restaurants and other facilities that prepare food. What you do to sanitize will vary, depending on your needs. You might be mopping a floor using a mop, a chemical, and water. You might use a dishwasher to sanitize the dishes. Or you could be using an antibacterial wipe on a tv remote.   If you both clean and disinfect a surface or object, you can further lower the risk of spreading infection. There are products that clean and disinfect at the same time.  Which surfaces and objects do I need to clean and disinfect? To prevent the spread of infection, you should regularly clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that are touched often. For example, in your house, this would include countertops, doorknobs, faucet and toilet handles, light switches, remotes, and toys.  How can I safely clean and disinfect? It's important to be safe when using cleaning and disinfecting products:  Store them in the containers they came in. Always follow the instructions and pay attention to the warnings on the label.  Do not mix cleaners and disinfectants unless the labels say that it is safe to do so. Combining certain products (such as chlorine bleach and ammonia cleaners) can cause serious injury or even death. Check the label to see whether you need to use gloves to protect your hands and/or eye protection when using the products If you swallow, inhale, or get them on your skin, follow the directions on the label or get medical help Store them out of the reach of children",

    "summary": "Cleft lip and cleft palate are birth defects that occur when a baby's lip or mouth do not form properly.  They happen early during pregnancy. A baby can have a cleft lip, a cleft palate, or both.  A cleft lip happens if the tissue that makes up the lip does not join completely before birth. This causes an opening in the upper lip. The opening can be a small slit or a large opening that goes through the lip into the nose. It can be on one or both sides of the lip or, rarely, in the middle of the lip.  Children with a cleft lip also can have a cleft palate. The roof of the mouth is called the \"palate.\" With a cleft palate, the tissue that makes up the roof of the mouth does not join correctly.  Babies may have both the front and back parts of the palate open, or they may have only one part open.  Children with a cleft lip or a cleft palate often have problems with feeding and talking. They also might have ear infections, hearing loss, and problems with their teeth.  Often, surgery can close the lip and palate. Cleft lip surgery is usually done before age 12 months, and cleft palate surgery is done before 18 months. Many children have other complications. They may need additional surgeries, dental and orthodontic care, and speech therapy as they get older. With treatment, most children with clefts do well and lead a healthy life.

It is mostly available as an illegal drug that some people use to get high. In rare cases, it is also used as a prescription drug for for anesthesia during certain surgeries.  As a street (illegal) drug, cocaine is usually a fine, white, crystal powder. Street dealers sometimes mix it with cornstarch, talcum powder, or flour to make it look like they have more cocaine. That way they can make more money. They may also mix it with other illegal drugs. Another form of the drug is crack cocaine. Crack cocaine has been heated to make it into a rock crystal.  How do people use cocaine? People snort cocaine powder through the nose or rub it into their gums. Others dissolve the powder and inject it into the bloodstream. Some people inject a combination of cocaine and heroin, called a \"speedball.\" Crack cocaine is smoked.  What are the short-term effects of cocaine? Cocaine is a stimulant that can make people feel like they have more energy and are extra alert. But it can also make people feel restless, irritable, anxious, and paranoid. Large amounts of cocaine can lead to bizarre, unpredictable, and violent behavior.  Cocaine's effects appear almost immediately and disappear within a few minutes to an hour. How long the effects last and how intense they are will depend on how the person used it.  In some cases, cocaine can cause very serious health problems such as a heart attack, stroke, or coma.  What are the long-term effects of cocaine? People who use cocaine over the long term may develop health problems. Which problems they have will depend on how they used the cocaine:  Snorting it can lead to a loss of sense of smell, nosebleeds, nasal damage, and trouble swallowing. Smoking it can cause a cough, asthma, trouble breathing, and a higher risk of infections like pneumonia. Injecting it with a needle can lead to skin or soft tissue infections, as well as scarring. It can cause collapsed veins. When a vein collapses, the blood cannot flow through it. Injecting cocaine also puts a person at higher risk of getting diseases such as HIV and hepatitis C.   Other long-term effects of cocaine use may include malnutrition and movement disorders, including Parkinson's disease.  Repeated use of cocaine can lead to tolerance. This means users need more and more of the drug to have the same effect. At higher doses over time, the body becomes dependent on cocaine. If someone who is dependent on cocaine stops using it, they will have withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms can include:  Depression Restlessness Fatigue Increased appetite Bad dreams and insomnia Slowed thinking   Repeated use of cocaine can also lead to cocaine use disorder, also called addiction. This is more than physical dependence. It's a chronic (long-lasting) brain disorder. When someone has it, they continue to use cocaine even though it causes problems in their life. Some examples include health problems and not being able to meet responsibilities at work, school, or home. Getting and using cocaine becomes their main purpose in life.  Can a person overdose on cocaine? It's possible to overdose on cocaine. This happens when a person uses so much cocaine that it causes a life-threatening reaction or death. Some people use cocaine along with other drugs or alcohol. This can increase the risk of an overdose.  A cocaine overdose can cause health problems such as:  Stroke Seizures irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) Heart attack   There is no specific medicine to treat an overdose. Health care providers will focus on treating the specific health problems caused by the overdose.  What are the treatments for cocaine use disorder? The treatments for cocaine use disorder are different types of behavioral therapies. There are no medicines which can treat it.  NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse",

Screening is testing for diseases when you have no symptoms. It may find diseases at an early stage, when they are easier to treat. If aren't at higher risk for colorectal cancer, your health care provider will likely recommend you start getting screenings at age 45. If you are at higher risk, you may need to start getting screened for colorectal cancer earlier. There are also other tests to screen for colorectal cancer, including stool tests.

To prepare for a colonoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, or flexible sigmoidoscopy, you will need to:  Talk with your doctor about any health problems you have and all of the medicines and supplements that you take. You may need to stop taking some of your medicines and/or supplements before the procedure. Follow the bowel prep instructions from your doctor.

Avoid red or purple drinks or gelatin; the dye can look like blood in the colon. You probably need to stop eating and drinking the night before the exam. \t\tYou will need to take some laxatives. They may be pills, a powder that you dissolve in liquid, an enema, or a combination of these. The laxative will cause diarrhea, so you need to stay close to the bathroom. \t   For a virtual colonoscopy, you will also need to drink a contrast medium the night before. The contrast medium is a dye or other substance that is visible on x-rays. It can help your doctor tell the difference between stool and polyps.  How are colonoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, and flexible sigmoidoscopy done?  For a colonoscopy:  You will have the procedure at a hospital or outpatient center. It usually takes 30 to 60 minutes. You will get IV (intravenous) sedatives or anesthesia, usually along with pain medicine, so you won't be awake or feel pain during the procedure.  You'll lie on a table while the doctor inserts a colonoscope through your anus and into your rectum and colon. The scope inflates your large intestine with air for a better view. The camera sends a video image to a monitor so your doctor can see your colon.  Once the scope reaches the opening to your small intestine, the doctor will slowly remove the scope. While doing so, your doctor will examine your colon again. If you have polyps, your doctor may remove them and send them to a lab for testing. Most polyps aren't cancer, but removing them can prevent them from becoming cancer later on. If you have abnormal tissue, your doctor may do a biopsy. The sedative or anesthesia takes time to wear off completely. You'll stay at the hospital or outpatient center for 1 to 2 hours after the procedure. Then you will need someone to drive you home.  For a virtual colonoscopy:  You will have the procedure at a hospital or outpatient center. It usually takes about 10 to 15 minutes. You do not need anesthesia. You'll lie on a table while a specially trained x-ray technician inserts a thin tube through your anus and into your rectum. The tube inflates your large intestine with air for a better view.  The table slides into a tunnel-shaped device where the technician takes the x-ray images. You will turn over on your side or stomach to get more images taken.  For a flexible sigmoidoscopy:  You will have the procedure at a hospital, medical office, or outpatient center. It usually takes about 20 minutes. You do not need anesthesia. You'll lie on a table while the doctor inserts a thin tube through your anus and into your rectum. The tube inflates your large intestine with air for a better view. The camera sends a video image to a monitor so your doctor can see your lower colon.  Once the scope has reached the top of the lower colon, the doctor will slowly remove the scope. While doing so, your doctor will examine your lower colon again. If you have polyps, your doctor may remove them and send them to a lab for testing. Most polyps aren't cancer, but removing them can prevent them from becoming cancer later on. If you have abnormal tissue, your doctor may do a biopsy.   What should I expect after a colonoscopy, virtual colonoscopy, or flexible sigmoidoscopy? You may feel cramping in your abdomen or bloating during the first hour after the any of these procedures. If the doctor removed polyps or performed a biopsy, you may have light bleeding from your anus. This bleeding is normal.  For a virtual colonoscopy or a flexible sigmoidoscopy, you go back to your regular activities and diet right after the test. For a colonoscopy, you can expect a full recovery and return to your normal diet by the next day.  Your doctor will give you the results of your procedure. If you had a biopsy, it can take a few days to get those results.  NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

    "disease": "Colorectal Cancer",
    "summary": "What is colorectal cancer? Colorectal cancer is cancer that develops in the tissues of the colon or rectum. Your colon and rectum are part of your digestive system:  Your colon is the first and longest part of your large intestine. It absorbs water and some nutrients from foods. It also changes the leftover waste products into stool (poop).  Your rectum is the lower part of your large intestine. It's where your body stores stool.  Cancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer, and cancer that begins in the rectum is called rectal cancer. Cancer that affects either of these parts may also be called colorectal cancer.  What causes colorectal cancer? Colorectal cancer happens when there are changes in your genetic material (DNA). These changes are also called mutations or variants. Often, the genetic changes that lead to colorectal cancer happen during your lifetime and the exact cause is unknown. But certain genetic changes that raise your risk for colorectal cancer are inherited, meaning that you are born with them.  Besides genetics, other factors, including your lifestyle and the environment, can affect your risk of colorectal cancer.  Who is more likely to develop colorectal cancer?  Anyone can get colorectal cancer, but certain factors make you more likely to develop it:  Being older; your risk of getting colorectal cancer increases as you age. Having a personal or family history of colorectal cancer. Having a history of adenomas. Adenomas are colorectal polyps (growths) that look abnormal under a microscope or are 1 centimeter or larger. Adenomas are not cancer, but they can sometimes turn into cancer over time. Having a genetic syndrome such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer). Having chronic ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease for 8 years or more. Having three or more alcoholic drinks per day. Smoking cigarettes. Being Black; Black people have an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer compared to other races. Having obesity.   What are the symptoms of colorectal cancer? Colorectal cancer may not always cause symptoms, especially at first. If you do have symptoms, they could include:  A change in bowel habits that lasts more than a few days, such as: \t \t\tDiarrhea \t\tConstipation \t\tFeeling that the bowel does not empty completely \t\tYour stool is narrower or has a different shape than usual \t  Blood (either bright red or very dark) in the stool Frequent gas pains, bloating, fullness, or cramps Weight loss for no known reason Fatigue   What is screening for colorectal cancer and who needs it? Because colorectal cancer may not cause symptoms at first, it's important to have screening tests for colorectal cancer. Screening tests look for signs of a disease before you have any symptoms. They can help find cancer early, when it may be easier to treat.  Most experts recommend that start screenings at 45 and continue until at least age 75. People over 75 and those who are at high risk should talk to their providers about how often you need screening and what type of test they should get.   The types of tests include different stool tests and procedures such as colonoscopies and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Talk with your provider about how often you need screening and what type of test you should get.  How is colorectal cancer diagnosed? If you have symptoms that could be caused by colorectal cancer or if your screening test results are abnormal, you may need to have more tests to find out if you have cancer. Possible tests include:  A physical exam. A digital rectal exam. For this exam, your provider inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum to feel for lumps or anything unusual. The tests that are also used for screening (colonoscopy, stool tests, etc.) and biopsy, if you have not already had them. Other blood and tissue tests.   What are the treatments for colorectal cancer? Your treatment options usually depend on your age, your general health, how serious the cancer is, and which type of cancer you have.  For colon cancer, your treatment may include one or more of these options:  Surgery. Radiofrequency ablation, a procedure that uses radio waves to heat and destroy abnormal cells. The radio waves travel through electrodes (small devices that carry electricity). Cryosurgery, a procedure in which an extremely cold liquid or an instrument called a cryoprobe is used to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue.  Chemotherapy. Radiation therapy. Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. Immunotherapy.   For rectal cancer, your treatment may include one or more of these options:  Surgery. Radiation therapy. Chemotherapy. Active surveillance, which means having regular tests to see if your rectal cancer has changed. If the tests show the cancer is starting to grow, then you will have treatment to try to cure the cancer. Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells. Immunotherapy.   Can colorectal cancer be prevented? Avoiding the risk factors that you have control over may help prevent some cancers. That includes:  Not smoking Limiting alcohol to under three drinks per day Managing your weight   There are also other steps you can take to try to prevent colorectal cancer. They include:  Getting regular colorectal cancer screenings Having polyps removed before they can become cancerous Getting regular exercise",

Adults have an average of 2-3 colds per year, and children have even more. Colds are more common in the winter and spring, but you can get them at any time.    What causes the common cold? More than 200 different viruses can cause a cold, but rhinoviruses are the most common type. The viruses that cause colds are very contagious. They can spread from person to person through the air and close personal contact. You can also get infected when you touch something that has the virus on it and then touch your eyes, mouth, or nose. For example, you could get a cold after you shake hands with someone who has a cold or touch a doorknob that has the germs on it, and then touch your face.   What are the symptoms of the common cold? The symptoms of a common cold usually include:  Sneezing Stuffy nose (congestion) Runny nose Sore throat Coughing Headache   The symptoms usually start a few days after you become infected with the virus. Some symptoms can last for 10-14 days.   What are the treatments for the common cold? There is no cure for the common cold. But there are treatments that can make you feel better while you wait for the cold to go away on its own:  Getting lots of rest. Drinking plenty of fluids. Using a clean humidifier or cool mist vaporizer. Gargling with warm salt water.  Using saline nose drops or sprays. Taking over-the-counter pain or cold and cough medicines. But you need to be careful with certain medicines: \t \t\tChildren and teens should not take aspirin.  \t\tSome cold and cough medicines contain ingredients that are not recommended for children. Talk with your child's health care provider before giving your child any cold and cough medicines. \t\tSome cold and cough medicines contain pain relievers. If you also take a separate pain reliever with these medicines, you could be getting a dangerous amount of the pain reliever. Read the labels on the medicines and follow the instructions carefully. If you have questions, ask your provider or a pharmacist. \t    Antibiotics will not help with a cold. Antibiotics help with bacterial infections, not with viral infections such as colds.  Most people who have a cold will feel better after a week or two. However, some people who get a cold may develop other illnesses, such as bronchitis or pneumonia. This is more common in people with weakened immune systems, asthma, or other respiratory conditions. Contact your provider if you or your child have symptoms that concern you, such as:  Trouble breathing or fast breathing Dehydration Fever that lasts longer than 4 days Symptoms that last more than 10 days without improvement Symptoms, such as fever or cough, that improve but then return or worsen Worsening of chronic medical conditions   Can the common cold be prevented? There is no vaccine to protect against the common cold. But you may be able to reduce your risk of getting or spreading a cold by:  Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands. Avoiding close contact, such as kissing, shaking hands, and sharing cups and eating utensils, with others if you are sick or they are sick.

    "summary": "A concussion is a type of brain injury.  It involves a short loss of normal brain function. It happens when a hit to the head or body causes your head and brain to move rapidly back and forth. This sudden movement can cause the brain to bounce around or twist in the skull, creating chemical changes in your brain. Sometimes it can also stretch and damage your brain cells.   Sometimes people call a concussion a \"mild\" brain injury. It is important to understand that while concussions may not be life-threatening, they can still be serious.  Concussions are a common type of sports injury. Other causes of concussions include blows to the head, bumping your head when you fall, being violently shaken, and car accidents.  Symptoms of a concussion may not start right away; they may start days or weeks after the injury. Symptoms may include a headache or neck pain. You may also have nausea, ringing in your ears, dizziness, or tiredness. You may feel dazed or not your normal self for several days or weeks after the injury. Consult your health care professional if any of your symptoms get worse, or if you have more serious symptoms such as: Convulsions or seizures  Drowsiness or inability to wake up A headache that gets worse and does not go away Weakness, numbness, or decreased coordination Repeated vomiting or nausea Confusion Slurred speech Loss of consciousness   To diagnose a concussion, your health care provider will do a physical exam and will ask about your injury. You will most likely have a neurological exam, which checks your vision, balance, coordination, and reflexes. Your health care provider may also evaluate your memory and thinking. In some cases, you may also have a scan of the brain, such as a CT scan or an MRI. A scan can check for bleeding or inflammation in the brain, as well as a skull fracture (break in the skull).  Most people recover fully after a concussion, but it can take some time. Rest is very important after a concussion because it helps the brain to heal. In the very beginning, you may need to limit physical activities or activities that involve a lot of concentration, such as studying, working on the computer, or playing video games. Doing these may cause concussion symptoms (such as headache or tiredness) to come back or get worse.

    "disease": "Congenital Heart Defects",
    "summary": "What are congenital heart defects? Congenital heart defects (CHDs) are problems with the structure of the heart. \"Congenital\" means that that the problems are present at birth. These defects happen when a fetus's heart doesn't develop normally during pregnancy. Congenital heart defects are the most common type of birth defect.  Congenital heart defects can change the way the heart pumps blood. They may make blood flow too slowly, go the wrong way, or block it completely.    There are many types of congenital heart defects. They can happen in one or more parts of the heart. The most common types are:  Septal defects (\"hole in the heart\") - openings in the wall between the left and right sides of the heart Heart valve defects - problems with the valves that control the flow of blood through the heart Defects in the large blood vessels that carry blood in and out of the heart   Congenital heart defects can range from very mild problems that never need treatment to life-threatening problems at birth. The most serious congenital heart defects are called critical congenital heart disease. Babies with these defects usually need surgery in the first year of life. But the symptoms of milder heart defects may not show up until childhood or adulthood.  What causes congenital heart defects? Researchers often don't know what causes congenital heart defects. They do know that changes in a baby's genes sometimes cause a heart defect. The changed genes may come from the parents, or the changes may happen during pregnancy.   Who is more likely to have a baby with a congenital heart defect? Several things may increase the chance that your baby has a congenital heart defect, such as:  Your health before and during pregnancy, including: \t \t\tHaving diabetes before pregnancy or developing it in the first 3 months of pregnancy (diabetes that develops later in pregnancy isn't a major risk for heart defects). Carefully controlling your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, before and during pregnancy can lower your baby's risk of congenital heart defects.  \t\tHaving phenylketonuria (PKU), a rare inherited disorder that affects how the body uses a protein in foods. If you have PKU, eating a low-protein diet before getting pregnant can lower your baby's risk of having a congenital heart defect.  \t\tHaving rubella (German measles) during pregnancy. \t  Your contact with certain substances during pregnancy, including: \t \t\tSmoking or secondhand smoke (breathing smoke from another smoker). \t\tCertain medicines, such as angiotensin-converting (ACE) inhibitors for high blood pressure and retinoic acids for acne. If you're pregnant or plan to get pregnant, talk with your health care provider about all the medicines you take.  \t  Your family history and genetics. In most cases, congenital heart defects don't run in families. But your chance of having a baby with a congenital heart defect does go up if you or the other parent has a congenital heart defect, or if you already have a child with a congenital heart defect.    What are the symptoms of congenital heart defects? Congenital heart defects don't cause pain. The signs and symptoms are different, depending on the type and number of defects and how serious they are.  Common signs and symptoms of congenital heart defects include:  Cyanosis - a bluish color to the skin, lips, and fingernails. It happens when there isn't enough oxygen in the blood. Fatigue - your baby may be unusually sleepy and may become very tired during feedings. Poor blood flow. Fast or difficult breathing. Heart murmur - an unusual sound between heartbeats.   What other problems do congenital heart defects cause? Congenital heart defects don't always cause other problems. If they do, which problems you have would depend on the type and number of defects and how serious the defects are.   Children with congenital heart defects are more likely to:  Be smaller than other children Have problems or delays in mental, and emotional growth, and behavior, such as: \t \t\tSpeech and language problems \t\tAttention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) \t    People with congenital heart defects may develop other health conditions, including:  Endocarditis - an infection of lining of the heart and valves Arrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat Heart failure - when your heart can't pump enough blood to the body Pulmonary hypertension - high blood pressure in your lungs Kidney and liver disease   How are congenital heart defects diagnosed?   Before a baby is born, your provider may use ultrasound pictures of the fetus's heart to look for heart defects. This is called a fetal echocardiogram. It's done between weeks 18 and 22 of pregnancy. During the first few days after birth, all newborns are checked for congenital heart defects. A pulse oximeter is clipped to your baby's hands or feet to measure blood oxygen. If it shows low levels of blood oxygen, more tests will be needed to find out if your baby has a heart defect.  To diagnose congenital heart defects in babies, children, and adults, a provider may use many tools, including: \t \t\tA physical exam. \t\tCertain heart tests to see how the heart is working. \t\tGenetic testing to see if certain gene problems caused the defect. \t    What are the treatments for congenital heart defects?  Treatment depends on the type of congenital heart defect and how serious it is. Possible treatments include:  Cardiac catheterization to repair simple defects, such as a small hole in the inside wall of the heart. A catheterization uses a thin tube guided through a vein and into the heart. Heart surgery may be needed to: \t \t\tRepair defects in the heart and blood vessels. \t\tRepair or replace a heart valve. \t\tPlace a device in the chest to help the heart pump blood. \t\tDo a heart transplant  \t  Medicine is often used if your baby has a specific type of congenital heart defect called patent ductus arteriosus.   All children and adults who have congenital heart defects need regular follow-up care from a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) throughout their life, even if their defect was repaired.   Some people may need several heart surgeries or catheterizations over the years. They may also need to take medicines to help their hearts work as well as possible.

    "summary": "What is COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?  COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time.  Normally, the airways and air sacs in your lungs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, the airways bring air to the air sacs. The air sacs fill up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out. If you have COPD, less air flows in and out of your airways because of one or more problems: The airways and air sacs in your lungs become less elastic The walls between many of the air sacs are destroyed The walls of the airways become thick and inflamed The airways make more mucus than usual and can become clogged   What are the types of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)?  COPD includes two main types: Emphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs, as well as the walls between them. They become damaged and are less elastic.  Chronic bronchitis, in which the lining of your airways is constantly irritated and inflamed. This causes the lining to swell and make mucus.   Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person.  What causes COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? The cause of COPD is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause COPD, especially if you inhale them.  Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to COPD. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace. Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing COPD.  Who is at risk for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? The risk factors for COPD include: Smoking. This is the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have COPD smoke or used to smoke.  Long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace Age. Most people who have COPD are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.  Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get COPD are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD. Asthma. People who have asthma have more risk of developing COPD than people who don't have asthma. But most people with asthma will not get COPD.   What are the symptoms of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include: Frequent coughing or a cough that produces a lot of mucus Wheezing A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity Tightness in your chest   Some people with COPD get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. In severe cases, COPD can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs.  How is COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A family history Various tests, such as lung function tests, a chest x-ray or CT scan, and blood tests   Your doctor will diagnose COPD based on your signs and symptoms, your medical and family histories, and test results.  What are the treatments for COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)? There is no cure for COPD. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include: Lifestyle changes, such as \t \t\tQuitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat COPD. \t\tAvoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants \t\tAsk your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness. \t  Medicines, such as \t \t\tBronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation. \t\tVaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with COPD are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases \t\tAntibiotics if you get a bacterial lung infection \t  Oxygen therapy, if you have severe COPD and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times. Pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include \t \t\tAn exercise program \t\tDisease management training \t\tNutritional counseling \t\tPsychological counseling \t  Surgery, usually as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines: \t \t\tFor COPD that is mainly related to emphysema, there are surgeries that:  \t\t\t \t\t\t\tRemove damaged lung tissue \t\t\t\tRemove large air spaces (bullae) that can form when air sacs are destroyed. The bullae can interfere with breathing.  \t\t\t \t\t \t\tFor severe COPD, some people may need lung transplant \t    If you have COPD, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever.   Can COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) be prevented? Since smoking causes most cases of COPD, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts.  NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "disease": "Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery",
    "summary": "What is coronary artery bypass surgery? Coronary artery bypass surgery creates a new path for blood to flow to your heart. This surgery is sometimes called a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or heart bypass. It's the most common heart surgery in adults. You may need this surgery if you have a blocked or partially blocked artery in your heart.  This surgery is often used to treat coronary artery disease (CAD). Your coronary arteries supply blood to your heart. If you have coronary artery disease, a sticky material called plaque builds up in your coronary arteries. This can cause them to harden and narrow. When this happens, some parts of your heart don't get enough blood.  Before recommending surgery, your health care provider may try other treatments. These could include lifestyle changes, medicines, or angioplasty, a procedure to open your arteries. If these treatments don't help, you may need coronary artery bypass surgery.   Who might benefit from coronary artery bypass surgery? Your provider may recommend surgery if you have obstructive coronary artery disease to help lower your risk of a heart attack. They will consider your overall health before deciding if surgery is your best option.  You may benefit from surgery if you have:   Coronary heart disease with angina (chest pain) Diabetes Multiple blocked coronary arteries Serious heart failure    You might need emergency coronary artery bypass surgery to treat a severe heart attack.  What happens during coronary artery bypass surgery? During surgery, the surgeon takes healthy blood vessels from another part of your body. These blood vessels are attached to blood vessels above and below the blocked artery to let blood bypass (get around) the blockage. You might need more than one bypass if you have a few blocked arteries.  Methods to perform coronary artery bypass surgery include:  Traditional CABG. The chest is cut open to reach the heart. A machine pumps blood through your body during the surgery. This is the most common type of CABG surgery. Off-pump CABG. The chest is cut open to reach the heart. A machine for pumping blood is not used. Minimally invasive CABG methods. Small cuts are made in the chest. A machine for pumping blood is not used. Robotic-assisted surgery. This is a type of minimally invasive surgery. The surgeon uses a computer to control tools on the arms of a robot. A machine for pumping blood may be used.   Are there any risks from coronary artery bypass surgery? Like all surgery, CABG has risks even though the results are often excellent. The risks can include:  Arrhythmia  Bleeding Heart attack Infection Kidney failure Stroke   After coronary artery bypass surgery, many people remain symptom-free for years. You may need surgery again if blockages form in the grafted arteries or veins. Or if blockages happen in arteries that weren't blocked before. Lifestyle changes and medicines may help stop your arteries from becoming clogged again. NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "summary": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the most common type of heart disease. It is the leading cause of death in the United States in both men and women.  CAD happens when the arteries that supply blood to heart muscle become hardened and narrowed. This is due to the buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. As it grows, less blood can flow through the arteries. As a result, the heart muscle can't get the blood or oxygen it needs. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or a heart attack.  Most heart attacks happen when a blood clot suddenly cuts off the hearts' blood supply, causing permanent heart damage.    Over time, CAD can also weaken the heart muscle and contribute to heart failure and arrhythmias. Heart failure means the heart can't pump blood well to the rest of the body. Arrhythmias are changes in the normal beating rhythm of the heart.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

If you haven't had any CPR training, you can do \"hands-only\" CPR for a teen or adult whose heart has stopped beating (\"hands-only\" CPR isn't recommended for children). \"Hands-only\" CPR uses chest compressions to keep blood circulating. Chest compressions involve pushing hard and fast in the center of the chest. If you've had training, you can use chest compressions, clear the airway, and do rescue breathing. Rescue breathing helps get oxygen to the lungs for a person who has stopped breathing. To keep your skills up, repeat the CPR training every two years.

It can affect any part of your digestive tract, which runs from your mouth to your anus. But it usually affects your small intestine and the beginning of your large intestine.  Crohn's disease is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis are other common types of IBD.  What causes Crohn's disease? The cause of Crohn's disease is unknown. Researchers think that an autoimmune reaction may be one cause. An autoimmune reaction happens when your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body. Genetics may also play a role, since Crohn's disease can run in families. Stress and eating certain foods don't cause the disease, but they can make your symptoms worse.  Who is more likely to develop Crohn's disease? There are certain factors that may raise your risk of Crohn's disease: Family history of the disease. Having a parent, child, or sibling with the disease puts you at higher risk. Smoking. This may double your risk of developing Crohn's disease. Certain medicines, such as antibiotics, birth-control pills, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin or ibuprofen. These may slightly increase your chance of developing Crohn's. A high-fat diet. This may also slightly increase your risk of Crohn's.    What are the symptoms of Crohn's disease? The symptoms of Crohn's disease can vary, depending where and how severe your inflammation is. The most common symptoms include: Diarrhea Cramping and pain in your abdomen Weight loss  Some other possible symptoms are: Anemia, a condition in which you have fewer red blood cells than normal Eye redness or pain Fatigue Fever Joint pain or soreness Nausea or loss of appetite Skin changes that involve red, tender bumps under the skin  Stress and eating certain foods such as carbonated (fizzy) drinks and high-fiber foods may make some people's symptoms worse.  What other problems can Crohn's disease cause? Crohn's disease can cause other problems, including: Intestinal obstruction, a blockage in the intestine Fistulas, abnormal connections between two parts inside of the body Abscesses, pus-filled pockets of infection Anal fissures, small tears in your anus that may cause itching, pain, or bleeding Ulcers, open sores in your mouth, intestines, anus, or perineum Malnutrition, when your body does not get the right amount of vitamins, minerals, and nutrients it needs Inflammation in other areas of your body, such as your joints, eyes, and skin   How is Crohn's disease diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A family history A physical exam, including: \t \t\tChecking for bloating in your abdomen. \t\tListening to sounds within your abdomen using a stethoscope. \t\tTapping on your abdomen to check for tenderness and pain and to see if your liver or spleen is abnormal or enlarged. \t \t Various tests, including: \t \t\tBlood and stool tests. \t\tA colonoscopy. \t\tAn upper GI endoscopy, a procedure in which your provider uses a scope to look inside your mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. \t\tDiagnostic imaging tests, such as a CT scan or an upper GI series. An upper GI series uses a special liquid called barium and x-rays. Drinking the barium will make your upper GI tract more visible on an x-ray. \t    What are the treatments for Crohn's disease? There is no cure for Crohn's disease, but treatments can decrease inflammation in your intestines, relieve symptoms, and prevent complications. Treatments include medicines, bowel rest, and surgery. No single treatment works for everyone. You and your provider can work together to figure out which treatment is best for you: Medicines for Crohn's include various medicines that decrease the inflammation. Many of these medicines do this by reducing the activity of your immune system. Certain medicines can also help with symptoms or complications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anti-diarrheal medicines. If your Crohn's causes an infection, you may need antibiotics. Bowel rest involves drinking only certain liquids or not eating or drinking anything. This allows your intestines to rest. You may need to do this if your Crohn's disease symptoms are severe. You get your nutrients through drinking a liquid, a feeding tube, or an intravenous (IV) tube. You may need to do bowel rest in the hospital, or you may be able to do it at home. It will last for a few days or up to several weeks.  Surgery can treat complications and reduce symptoms when other treatments are not helping enough. The surgery will involve removing a damaged part of your digestive tract to treat: \t \t\tFistulas \t\tBleeding that is life threatening \t\tIntestinal obstructions \t\tSide effects from medicines when they threaten your health \t\tSymptoms when medicines do not improve your condition \t \t  Changing your diet can help reduce symptoms. Your provider may recommend that you make changes to your diet, such as: Avoiding carbonated drinks Avoiding popcorn, vegetable skins, nuts, and other high-fiber foods Drinking more liquids Eating smaller meals more often Keeping a food diary to help identify foods that cause problems   In some cases, your provider may ask you to go on a special diet, such as a diet that is:  High calorie Lactose free Low fat Low fiber Low salt   If you are not absorbing enough nutrients, you may need to take nutritional supplements and vitamins.

These parasites live in soil, food, and water. They are found in every region of the United States and throughout the world. Crypto can also be found on surfaces or dirty hands that have been contaminated with the stool (poop) of humans or animals that have the infection.  How is cryptosporidiosis spread? You can become infected with Crypto by swallowing the parasite if it is in your food, drinking water, or water that you swim in. You can also get infected when you touch something that has been contaminated, and then you touch your eyes, mouth, or nose. Another way that Crypto can spread is through sexual contact.  Who is more likely to get cryptosporidiosis? Certain people are more likely to get Crypto; they include:  Children and workers at childcare centers Older adults (ages 75 years and older) People who take care of other people with Crypto International travelers Backpackers, hikers, and campers who drink unfiltered, untreated water People, including swimmers, who swallow water from contaminated sources People who touch infected animals, often cows or sheep   What are the symptoms of cryptosporidiosis? The most common symptom of cryptosporidiosis is watery diarrhea. Other symptoms include:  Dehydration Weight loss Stomach cramps or pain Fever Nausea and vomiting   The symptoms generally begin 2 to 10 days after becoming infected with the parasite. In people with healthy immune systems, the symptoms can last about 1 to 2 weeks. Occasionally, the symptoms can last longer or come and go for up to 30 days.  People with weakened immune systems may develop a serious, chronic illness. Some reasons why you might have a weakened immune system could include:  Having HIV Having cancer Having a genetic condition that affects the immune system Taking certain medicines, such as chemotherapy and medicines needed after an organ transplant   Some people may not have any symptoms at all.  Contact your health care provider if you have watery diarrhea that lasts more than a few days, especially if you have a weakened immune system.  How is cryptosporidiosis diagnosed? Cryptosporidiosis is diagnosed by examining stool samples, usually under a microscope. People with Crypto can have many parasites in their stool one day but not as many the next day. So you may need to give the lab three stool samples collected on three different days. This helps make sure that your diagnosis is correct.  What are the treatments for cryptosporidiosis? Most people with cryptosporidiosis get better without treatment. It usually takes about one to two weeks.  It's important to drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration if you are pregnant. Infants and young children should also get extra fluids. They should get extra fluids. If you are pregnant or if you think that you or your child are severely dehydrated, contact your provider about how to get enough fluids. Some people who are dehydrated may need to get intravenous (IV) fluids in a hospital.  Over-the-counter anti-diarrheal medicine might help slow down diarrhea, but do not take it without first asking your provider. There is a medicine to treat diarrhea caused by Crypto in people with healthy immune systems. You and your provider can talk about whether that medicine is right for you.  Can cryptosporidiosis be prevented? To lower your chance of getting or spreading Crypto:  Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after using the toilet, changing diapers, or touching animals. You also need to wash your hands before eating or preparing food. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are not effective against Crypto. Only drink water that you know is safe. Only drink milk and apple cider that have been pasteurized. Don't eat uncooked foods when traveling in countries where the food supply might be unsafe. Never go swimming when you have diarrhea. Don't swallow water when you go swimming. Use condoms or dental dams every time you have sex. This will also help prevent other sexually transmitted infections.

    "disease": "CT Scans",
    "summary": "What is a CT scan? Computed tomography (CT) is a type of medical imaging test that uses special x-ray equipment to make detailed pictures of the inside of your body.  A CT scan produces cross-sectional pictures, which are like slices of the body. These images show the size and structure of organs, bones, and other tissues. CT images can also be combined to create 3-dimensional (3D) views.  Health care providers use CT scans to diagnose, treat, and monitor many health conditions.  Who needs a CT scan? Your provider may suggest a CT scan for many reasons, including:   Fractures (broken bones) Cancer Tumors or masses Blood clots Signs of heart disease Spinal conditions Lung disease    CT scans may also be used to find the best place to perform a biopsy or help guide certain treatments. They may also be used to check for internal bleeding or injury after trauma or to evaluate the brain for certain conditions.  How do you prepare for a CT scan? You may be asked not to eat or drink for a few hours before the scan. Ask your provider if there are any special instructions to follow.  For some CT scans, you may receive a contrast material. Contrast helps certain parts of the body show up more clearly on the images. Depending on what area is being examined, contrast material might be given as:  A liquid to swallow A shot (injection) An enema (placed into the rectum)  CT scans use ionizing radiation at levels higher than a standard x-ray, but the amount is kept as low as possible. Always tell your provider if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.  How is a CT scan done? You may be asked to change clothes and remove jewelry or other items that could interfere with the scan.   During the scan, you lie still on a table. The table slowly passes through the center of a large donut-shaped machine. The x-ray tube rotates around your body to create images.  You may hear whirring sounds during the scan. You may be asked to hold your breath for short periods. The test is painless.  The scan usually takes a few minutes, but some may last up to 30 minutes, depending on the area being scanned.  What should you expect after a CT scan? Most people can return to normal activities right away. If you were given a contrast material, drinking fluids can help your body clear it.  A specialist called a radiologist reviews the images and shares the results with your provider.    NIH: National Cancer Institute",

It is often temporary and treatable.  There are three types of delirium: Hypoactive, when you are not active and seem sleepy, tired, or depressed Hyperactive, when you are restless or agitated Mixed, when you change back and forth between being hypoactive and hyperactive   What causes delirium? There are many different problems that can cause delirium. Some of the more common causes include: Advanced cancer. Alcohol or drugs, either from intoxication or withdrawal. This includes a serious type of alcohol withdrawal syndrome called delirium tremens. It usually happens to people who stop drinking after years of alcohol use disorder (AUD). Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Dementia. Hospitalization, especially in intensive care. Infections, such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and the flu. Medicines. This could be a side effect of a medicine, such as sedatives or opioids. Or it could be from withdrawal after stopping a medicine. Metabolic disorders. Organ failure, such as kidney or liver failure. Poisoning. Serious illnesses. Severe pain. Sleep deprivation. Surgeries, including reactions to anesthesia.   Who is more likely to get delirium? Certain factors put you at risk for delirium, including: Being in a hospital or nursing home Having dementia Having a serious illness or more than one illness Having an infection Older age Having surgery Taking medicines that affect the mind or behavior Taking high doses of pain medicines, such as opioids   What are the symptoms of delirium? The symptoms of delirium usually start suddenly, over a few hours or a few days. They often come and go. The most common symptoms include: Changes in alertness (usually more alert in the morning, less at night) Changing levels of consciousness Confusion Disorganized thinking, talking in a way that doesn't make sense Disrupted sleep patterns, sleepiness Emotional changes: anger, agitation, depression, irritability, overexcitement Hallucinations and delusions Memory problems, especially with short-term memory Trouble concentrating   How is delirium diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms Physical and neurological exams Mental status testing, which checks for problems with your thinking and alertness  Lab and  diagnostic imaging tests   Delirium and dementia have similar symptoms, so it can be hard to tell them apart. You can also have both at the same time. The differences between them are that:   Delirium starts suddenly and can cause hallucinations. It is mainly a problem with attention and staying alert. The symptoms may get better or worse and can last for hours or weeks. Dementia develops slowly and does not cause hallucinations. It usually starts with memory loss. The symptoms don't change often, like they can with delirium. Dementia almost never gets better.   What are the treatments for delirium? Treatment of delirium focuses on the causes and symptoms of delirium. The first step is to identify the cause. Often, treating the cause will lead to a full recovery. The recovery may take some time - weeks or sometimes even months. In the meantime, there may be treatments to manage the symptoms, such as: Controlling the environment, which includes making sure that the room is quiet and well-lit, having clocks or calendars in view, and having family members around Medicines, including those that control aggression or agitation and pain relievers if there is pain If needed, making sure that the person has a hearing aid, glasses, or other devices for communication   Can delirium be prevented? Treating the conditions that can cause delirium may reduce the risk of getting it. Hospitals can help lower the risk of delirium by avoiding sedatives and making sure that hospital rooms are kept quiet, calm, and well-lit. It can also help to have family members around and to have the same staff members treat the person each day (if possible).",

These functions include: Memory Language skills Visual perception (your ability to make sense of what you see) Problem solving Trouble with everyday tasks The ability to focus and pay attention   It is normal to become a bit more forgetful as you age. But dementia is not a normal part of aging. It is a serious disorder that interferes with your daily life.  What are the types of dementia? The most common types of dementia are known as neurodegenerative disorders. These are diseases in which the cells of the brain stop working or die. They include: Alzheimer's disease, which is the most common form of dementia among older people. People with Alzheimer's have plaques and tangles in their brain. These are abnormal buildups of different proteins. Beta-amyloid protein clumps up and forms plaques in between your brain cells. Tau protein builds up and forms tangles inside the nerve cells of your brain. There is also a loss of connection between nerve cells in the brain.  Lewy body dementia, which causes movement symptoms along with dementia. Lewy bodies are abnormal deposits of a protein in the brain. Frontotemporal disorders, which cause changes to certain parts of the brain: \t \t\tChanges in the frontal lobe lead to behavioral symptoms \t\tChanges in the temporal lobe lead to language and emotional disorders \t  Vascular dementia, which involves changes to the brain's blood supply. It is often caused by a stroke or atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) in the brain. Mixed dementia, which is a combination of two or more types of dementia. For example, some people have both Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia.   Other conditions can cause dementia or dementia-like symptoms, including: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare brain disorder Huntington's disease, an inherited, progressive brain disease Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), caused by repeated traumatic brain injury HIV-associated dementia (HAD)   Who is at risk for dementia? Certain factors can raise your risk for developing dementia, including: Aging. This is the biggest risk factor for dementia. Smoking Uncontrolled diabetes High blood pressure Drinking too much alcohol Having close family members who have dementia   What are the symptoms of dementia? The symptoms of dementia can vary, depending on which parts of the brain are affected. Often, forgetfulness is the first symptom.  Dementia also causes problems with the ability to think, problem solve, and reason. For example, people with dementia may: Get lost in a familiar neighborhood Use unusual words to refer to familiar objects Forget the name of a close family member or friend Forget old memories Need help doing tasks that they used to do by themselves    Some people with dementia cannot control their emotions and their personalities may change. They may become apathetic, meaning that they are no longer interested in normal daily activities or events. They may lose their inhibitions and stop caring about other peoples' feelings.  Certain types of dementia can also cause problems with balance and movement.  The stages of dementia range from mild to severe. In the mildest stage, it is just beginning to affect a person's functioning. In the most severe stage, the person is completely dependent on others for care.  How is dementia diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A physical exam Tests of your thinking, memory, and language abilities Other tests, such as blood tests, genetic tests, and brain scans A mental health evaluation to see whether a mental disorder is contributing to your symptoms   What are the treatments for dementia? There is no cure for most types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and Lewy body dementia. Treatments may help to maintain mental function longer, manage behavioral symptoms, and slow down the symptoms of disease. They may include: Medicines, which may temporarily improve memory and thinking or slow down their decline. They only work in some people. Other medicines can treat symptoms such as anxiety, depression, sleep problems, and muscle stiffness. Some of these medicines can cause strong side effects in people with dementia. It is important to talk to your health care provider about which medicines will be safe for you. Occupational therapy to help find ways to more easily do everyday activities Speech therapy to help with swallowing difficulties and trouble speaking loudly and clearly Mental health counseling to help people with dementia and their families learn how to manage difficult emotions and behaviors. It can also help them plan for the future. Music or art therapy to reduce anxiety and improve well-being   Can dementia be prevented? Researchers have not found a proven way to prevent dementia. Living a healthy lifestyle might influence some of your risk factors for dementia.",

Dengue spreads to people through the bite of an infected mosquito. It does not spread directly from person to person. However, the infection can be passed to the baby during pregnancy. In rare cases, it can spread through a blood transfusion, organ transplant, or needle stick injury (an accidental injury from a used needle)..   What are the symptoms of dengue and severe dengue? About one in four people infected with dengue will get sick. For those who do get sick, the infection can be mild or severe. The symptoms of dengue include:  A high fever Nausea and vomiting Rash Aches and pains (eye pain, usually behind the eyes, and pain in the muscles, joints, or bones)  The symptoms usually last two to seven days.  Severe dengue is a serious form of the illness. About 1 in 20 people who get sick with dengue will develop severe dengue. It can cause shock, internal bleeding, and even death. People are more likely to develop severe dengue if they have had dengue before, are pregnant, or are infants.  Watch for signs and symptoms of severe dengue. Warning signs usually begin about 24 - 48 hours after your fever has gone away. If you or your family member have these signs, get immediate medical care:  Severe abdominal (belly) pain and tenderness Vomiting at least 3 times in 24 hours Bleeding from the nose or gums Vomiting blood, or blood in the stool (poop) Feeling tired, restless, or irritable   How is dengue diagnosed?

    "disease": "Depression",
    "summary": "What is depression? Depression is more than a feeling of being sad or irritable for a few days. It's a serious mood disorder. As one of the most common mental disorders in the United States, depression can affect how you think, feel, and your everyday life. You may not know why you feel this way, but even basic daily activities such as sleeping, eating, or working may become difficult. Depression often needs long-term treatment but getting help at the earliest sign of a problem can help manage your symptoms.   What are the different types of depression? The most common types of depression are major depression and persistent depressive disorder.   Major depression symptoms include a depressed mood or a loss of interest. Symptoms affect your daily activities and last for at least two weeks.  Persistent depressive disorder (also called dysthymia or dysthymic disorder) has less severe depressive symptoms, but they last longer, usually for at least two years.    Other types of depression can include:  Seasonal affective disorder comes and goes with the seasons. It usually starts in late fall and early winter and goes away during the spring and summer. Bipolar disorder is sometimes called manic depression. This mood disorder can cause intense mood swings.   Depression with symptoms of psychosis is a severe form of depression that also has delusions (false beliefs) or hallucinations (seeing, hearing, or feeling something that isn't there).    What causes depression? There are a variety of things that may cause depression, including genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Depression can happen at any age and can affect anyone, but it's more common in women. This is often due to the physical and hormonal changes that women have during menstruation, pregnancy, the postpartum period, and menopause. Other mental disorders or chronic medical conditions such as diabetes, cancer, or heart disease may occur with depression. This may make the chronic condition or depression worse.   In some cases, there is no clear cause for depression.  Who is at risk of depression? You may be at a higher risk of depression if you have a close relative who has it or another mental health disorder. Going through trauma or stressful life events may raise your risk even more.   What are the symptoms of depression? Depression doesn't look the same on everyone. The type and number of symptoms of depression can vary and don't always appear like sadness. Depression may affect you differently based on your:  Age. The symptoms of depression may be different in a child, who may appear more irritable than sad. Teens may act out or have excessive sleepiness. The symptoms for an older adult may not be as obvious as other age groups. Sex. Men often show symptoms and coping behaviors differently than women. Rather than sad, men may appear angry or irritable. Medical conditions. Some medicines and medical conditions may cause symptoms that look like depression. Chronic conditions may make depression worse.   Symptoms of depression are ongoing and affect your day-to-day life. They can include:   Feeling sad or \"empty\" Losing interest in favorite activities Overeating, or not wanting to eat at all Sleeping too much, or not enough  Feeling very tired Feeling hopeless, irritable, anxious, or guilty Having aches and pains, headaches, cramps, or digestive problems Having thoughts of death or suicide Changing moods or behaviors  Increasing use of alcohol or drugs Isolating from family and friends   How is depression diagnosed? If you think you have depression, talk to your health care provider or a mental health provider. To be diagnosed with depression, your provider may use many tools:  A medical history will include asking about your symptoms and family history. To be diagnosed with depression, your symptoms must occur most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks. One of the symptoms must be a depressed mood or a loss of interest in most activities.  Medical tests may be done to rule out other medical conditions. Certain medicines and medical conditions (such as viruses or thyroid disorders) may cause symptoms like depression.  A physical exam to make sure another issue isn't causing your symptoms.   A mental health evaluation by your provider or a mental health provider.   What are the treatments for depression? Depression may need long-term treatment. Most treatments include medicines and/or psychotherapy (talk therapy):  Medicines such as antidepressants may help control your symptoms. You may need to try several medicines to find which works best for you. Medicine may take time to work and can have side effects. Don't stop taking your medicine without first talking with your provider. Contact your provider if you have any concerns about side effects from the medicine.  Psychotherapy (talk therapy) under the care of a mental health provider can help you recognize and change troubling emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. This may be done one-on-one or in a group setting. It can give you and your family support, education, skills, and coping strategies.  Light therapy has been shown to be effective for seasonal affective disorder (SAD).  Other treatments options may be considered if treatment isn't working or if depression is severe. These may include: \t \t\tElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a brain stimulation procedure that uses a mild electric current when you are under general anesthesia. ECT is most often used for severe depression that is not getting better with other treatments.  \t\tRepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a brain stimulation procedure that uses magnetic waves to relieve depression. It's not as powerful as ECT, but with rTMS, you don't need anesthesia. It also has a low risk of negative effects on your memory and thinking. \t    Can depression be prevented? Most cases of depression can't be prevented, but healthy lifestyle changes can have long-term benefits for your mental health. These can include:  Getting regular exercise  Having a consistent sleep schedule Controlling stress   If you, or someone you love is depressed, see your provider or a mental health provider. It's important to get treatment at the earliest sign of a problem. If you or someone you know has thoughts of hurting themselves or attempting suicide, get help right away.

These conditions can cause physical, learning, language, or behavior issues. They can include:  Learning disabilities. These conditions affect the ability to learn.  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This is a disorder that affects behavior, communication, and social skills. Cerebral palsy (CP). This is a condition that affects movement, coordination, and balance. Physical disabilities. These could include blindness or deafness. Conditions that can affect both physical and mental abilities. This could include Down syndrome.  These conditions can cause lifelong challenges in learning. Completing daily tasks may be difficult. Early treatment may help your child learn important skills and make the most of their strengths.  What causes developmental disabilities? Developmental disabilities are often present at birth. They can occur due to various reasons. These can include:  Genetic or chromosome abnormalities. These cause conditions such as Down syndrome, Fragile-X-Syndrome, and Rett syndrome. Use of substances while pregnant. For example, drinking alcohol when pregnant can cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Certain infections during pregnancy. Preterm birth or low birth weight.   How are developmental disabilities diagnosed? The way a developmental disability is diagnosed depends on the condition. Screening tests or a physical exam may be done to check for a medical problem. Other tests and questionnaires may help find out if your child has a developmental disability. These may include:  Screening tests that are done during pregnancy or for newborns Developmental and behavioral screening tests or questionnaires  to check if your child is developing on schedule Observing your child's behavior and how they interact with other people Testing your child's intellectual and school performance Asking about your family history   What are the treatments for developmental disabilities? If your child has a developmental disability, these are usually lifelong conditions. Often, there is no cure, but treatment can help the symptoms.

    "disease": "Diabetes",
    "summary": "What is diabetes? Diabetes, also known as diabetes mellitus, is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose is your body's main source of energy. Your body can make glucose, but it also comes from the food you eat. Insulin is a hormone made by your pancreas. Insulin helps move glucose from your bloodstream into your cells, where it can be used for energy.  If you have diabetes, your body can't make insulin, can't use insulin as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells. This can cause glucose levels to get too high. Over time, high blood glucose levels can lead to serious health conditions. But you can take steps to manage your diabetes and try to prevent these health problems.  What are the types of diabetes? There are different types of diabetes:  Type 1 diabetes. If you have type 1 diabetes, your body makes little or no insulin. It happens when your immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin.  Type 2 diabetes. This is the most common form of diabetes. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body may still be able to make insulin, but your cells don't respond well to insulin. They can't easily take up enough glucose from your blood. Gestational diabetes. This is a form of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It happens when your body can't make the extra insulin it needs during pregnancy.   What causes diabetes? The different types of diabetes have different causes:  Researchers think type 1 diabetes is caused by genes and factors in the environment that might trigger the disease. Type 2 diabetes is caused by several factors, including lifestyle factors and genes. The lifestyle factors include not being physically active and being overweight or having obesity. Researchers think gestational diabetes is caused by the hormonal changes of pregnancy along with genetic and lifestyle factors.   Who is more likely to develop diabetes? The different types of diabetes have different risk factors:  You can develop type 1 diabetes at any age, but it most often starts in childhood. Having a parent or sibling with type 1 diabetes may increase your chance of developing it. You are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:      Are overweight or have obesity.   Are over age 35. Children, teenagers, and younger adults can get diabetes, but it is more common in middle-aged and older adults.   Have a family history of diabetes.   Have prediabetes. This means that your blood glucose is higher than normal, but it's not high enough to be called diabetes.   Had gestational diabetes.   Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.   Are African American, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, or Pacific Islander.   Are not physically active.   Have certain other health conditions, such as high blood pressure or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).     You are at higher risk of developing gestational diabetes if you:      Are overweight or have obesity.   Have a family history of diabetes.   Had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy.   Have given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.   Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).   Are African American, Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander.       What are the symptoms of diabetes? The symptoms of diabetes may include:  Feeling very thirsty Feeling very hungry Urinating (peeing) more often, including at night Fatigue Blurry vision Numbness or tingling in the feet or hands Sores that do not heal Losing weight without trying   But it's important to know that your symptoms may vary, depending on which type you have:  The symptoms of type 1 diabetes usually come on quickly and can be severe. With type 2 diabetes, the symptoms often develop slowly, over several years. The symptoms can be so mild that you might not even notice them. Gestational diabetes often has no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may be mild. If you are pregnant, you will usually be screened for this condition between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy.    How is diabetes diagnosed? To find out if you have diabetes, your health care provider will use one or more glucose blood tests. There are several types, including the A1C test.  What are the treatments for diabetes? Treatment for diabetes involves managing your blood glucose levels:  If you have type 1 diabetes, you will need to take daily doses of insulin, either by injection or through a special pump. Some people also need to take another type of diabetes medicine that works with insulin. If you have type 2 diabetes, you may be able to manage or even reverse it by making lifestyle changes. These include eating a healthy diet, staying at healthy weight, and getting regular physical activity. Some people also need to take diabetes medicines to manage their diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, you may be able to lower your glucose levels by eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise. But be sure to talk to your provider about your treatment options. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after you give birth. But you will have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.   Checking your blood glucose levels is also an important part of managing your diabetes. Ask your provider about the best way to check your blood glucose level and how often you should check it.  Can diabetes be prevented? Type 1 diabetes can't be prevented.  You may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes through the same lifestyle changes that are used to manage diabetes (eating a healthy diet, staying at a healthy weight, and getting regular physical activity). These lifestyle changes may also help prevent gestational diabetes.  NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

Gestational diabetes often has no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, they may be mild, such as being thirstier than normal or having to urinate (pee) more often.  If you are pregnant, you will most likely be screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. But if you have an increased chance of developing gestational diabetes, you may be tested during your first prenatal visit. Your health care provider will use one or more blood glucose tests to check for gestational diabetes. You may have the glucose challenge test, the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), or both.  For these two tests, you will drink a sugary liquid and wait for an hour before your blood sample is taken. If you have an oral glucose tolerance test, you will also get your blood drawn after 2 and 3 hours.  How can diabetes affect my pregnancy? Having diabetes during pregnancy can affect your health. For example:  You are more likely to develop preeclampsia, a serious medical condition that causes a sudden increase in your blood pressure. You are more likely to need a cesarean delivery, because your baby is more likely to be bigger than average. Changes to your hormones and your body during pregnancy can affect your blood glucose levels. If you had diabetes before pregnancy, you may now need to adjust your meal plan, physical activity routine, and/or medicines. If you have any diabetes health problems, they may get worse during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after you have your baby. But you will be at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes later.   Having diabetes during pregnancy can also affect the health of your developing baby:  If you have high blood glucose levels at the beginning of your pregnancy, there is a higher risk of birth defects. Your baby will be at risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes later in life. Your baby is more likely to be born early. Your baby may have breathing problems or hypoglycemia (low blood glucose levels) right after birth. There is a higher risk of miscarriage and stillbirth.   How can I manage diabetes during pregnancy? There are steps you can take to manage your diabetes before, during, and after pregnancy. If you already have diabetes, the best time to control your blood glucose is before you get pregnant. High blood glucose levels can be harmful to your developing baby during the first weeks of pregnancy, even before you know you are pregnant. See your provider to help you plan for pregnancy. You can talk about how to lower the risk of health problems for you and your developing baby. You can also discuss your diet, physical activity, and which diabetes medicines are safe during pregnancy.  During your pregnancy, you will work with your provider to manage your blood glucose levels. You may be able to manage them with a healthy diet and regular physical activity. If that's not enough, then you will need to take diabetes medicines. It's also important that you:  Get regular prenatal checkups Take your prenatal vitamins Don't use harmful substances such as alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs   After pregnancy, there are steps you need to take to stay healthy:  If you had gestational diabetes, you are at risk of developing type 2 diabetes. You will be tested for it within 4 to 12 weeks after giving birth. Even if your blood glucose levels have returned to normal, you will need to get them tested every 1 to 3 years. If you already had diabetes before pregnancy, you and your provider will monitor changes to your blood glucose levels. They will tell you if you need to adjust your diabetes management plan.

With type 2 diabetes, your body does not make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, the glucose stays in your blood.  What health problems can diabetes cause? Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause complications, including: Eye disease, due to changes in fluid levels, swelling in the tissues, and damage to the blood vessels in the eyes. Foot problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow to your feet. Gum disease and other dental problems, because a high amount of glucose in your saliva helps harmful bacteria grow in your mouth. The bacteria combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque. Plaque also comes from eating foods that contain sugars or starches. Some types of plaque cause gum disease and bad breath. Other types cause tooth decay and cavities.  Heart disease and stroke, caused by damage to your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels. Kidney disease, due to damage to the blood vessels in your kidneys. Many people with diabetes develop high blood pressure. That can also damage your kidneys.  Nerve problems (diabetic neuropathy), caused by damage to the nerves and the small blood vessels that nourish your nerves with oxygen and nutrients. Sexual and bladder problems, caused by damage to the nerves and reduced blood flow in the genitals and bladder. Skin conditions, some of which are caused by changes in the small blood vessels and reduced circulation. People with diabetes are also more likely to have infections, including skin infections.   What other problems can people with diabetes have? If you have diabetes, you need to watch out for blood glucose levels that are too high (hyperglycemia) or too low for you (hypoglycemia). These can happen quickly and can become dangerous. Some of the causes include having another illness or infection and certain medicines. They can also happen if you don't get the right amount of diabetes medicines.

Common treatments include a diabetic meal plan, regular physical activity, and medicines. Some less common treatments are weight loss surgery for either type and an artificial pancreas or pancreatic islet transplantation for some people with type 1 diabetes.  Who needs diabetes medicines? People with type 1 diabetes need to take a diabetes medicine called insulin to control their blood sugar.  Some people with type 2 diabetes can control their blood sugar with healthy food choices and physical activity. But for others, a diabetic meal plan and physical activity are not enough. They need to take diabetes medicines.  The kind of medicine you take depends on your type of diabetes, daily schedule, medicine costs, and any other health conditions that you have. Over time, you may need to take more than one diabetes medicine.  What are the types of medicines for type 1 diabetes? If you have type 1 diabetes, you must take insulin because your body no longer makes it. There are different types of insulin that start to work at different speeds, and the effects of each last a different length of time. Your health care provider will measure your blood glucose to decide on the type of insulin. You may need to use more than one type.   You will also need to check your blood sugar at home.  Your provider will tell you how often. The results of your blood sugar testing can help you make decisions about food, physical activity, and medicines.   You can take insulin several different ways. The most common are with a needle and syringe, an insulin pen, or an insulin pump. If you use a needle and syringe or a pen, you have to take insulin several times during the day, including with meals. An insulin pump gives you small, steady doses throughout the day. Less common ways to take insulin include inhalers, injection ports, and jet injectors.  In rare cases, taking insulin alone might not be enough to manage your blood sugar. Then you would need to take another diabetes medicine.  What are the types of medicines for type 2 diabetes? There are several different medicines for type 2 diabetes. Each works in a different way. Many of them are pills. There are also medicines that you inject under your skin, such as insulin.   Over time, you may need more than one diabetes medicine to manage your blood sugar. You might add another diabetes medicine or switch to a combination medicine.  A combination medicine contains more than one type of diabetes medicine in the same pill. Some people with type 2 diabetes take both pills and injections.  Even if you don't usually take insulin, you may need it at special times, such as during pregnancy or if you are in the hospital.   What else should I know about taking medicines for diabetes? Even if you take medicines for diabetes, you still need to eat a healthy diet, stop smoking, take your other medicines, and get regular physical activity. These will help you manage your diabetes.  It is important to make sure that you understand your diabetes treatment plan.

Type 2 diabetes may be caused by a combination of factors: Being overweight or having obesity Not being physically active Genetics and family history   Type 2 diabetes usually starts with insulin resistance. This is a condition in which your cells don't respond normally to insulin. As a result, your body needs more insulin to help the glucose enter your cells. At first, your body makes more insulin to try to get cells to respond. But over time, your body can't make enough insulin, and your blood glucose levels rise.  Who is at risk for type 2 diabetes? You are at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes if you:  Are over age 45. Children, teenagers, and younger adults can get type 2 diabetes, but it is more common in middle-aged and older people. Have prediabetes, which means that your blood glucose is high for you but not high enough to be called diabetes Had diabetes in pregnancy or gave birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more.

Many people with type 2 diabetes have no symptoms at all. If you do have them, the symptoms develop slowly over several years. They might be so mild that you do not notice them. The symptoms can include: Increased thirst and urination Increased hunger Feeling tired Blurred vision Numbness or tingling in the feet or hands Sores that do not heal Unexplained weight loss   How is type 2 diabetes diagnosed? Your provider will use blood tests to diagnose type 2 diabetes. The blood tests include: A1C test, which measures your average blood glucose level over the past 3 months. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your current blood glucose level. You need to fast (not eat or drink anything except water) for at least 8 hours before the test. Random plasma glucose (RPG) test, which measures your current blood glucose level. This test is used when you have diabetes symptoms and the provider does not want to wait for you to fast before having the test.    What are the treatments for type 2 diabetes? Treatment for type 2 diabetes involves managing your blood glucose levels. Many people are able to do this by living a healthy lifestyle. Some people may also need to take medicine:  A healthy lifestyle includes following a healthy eating plan and getting regular physical activity. You need to learn how to balance what you eat and drink with physical activity and diabetes medicine, if you take any. Medicines for diabetes include oral medicines, insulin, and other injectable medicines. Over time, some people will need to take more than one type of medicine to control their diabetes. You will need to check your blood glucose regularly. Your provider will tell you how often you need to do it. It's also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol levels close to the targets your provider sets for you. Make sure to get your screening tests regularly.   Can type 2 diabetes be prevented? You can take steps to help prevent or delay type 2 diabetes by losing weight if you are overweight, eating fewer calories, and being more physically active. If you have a condition which raises your risk for type 2 diabetes, managing that condition may lower your risk of getting type 2 diabetes.

A hormone called insulin helps glucose get into your cells.   With type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood glucose levels.   Prediabetes means that your blood glucose levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes.   How do the foods I eat affect my blood glucose levels? The glucose in your blood comes from certain foods called carbohydrates, or \"carbs.\" Foods that are high in carbs include candy and sweets, sodas, breads, tortillas, and white rice. The more carbs you eat, the higher your blood glucose level will be. Some, but not all people with diabetes, may need to count the amount of carbs eaten in drinks and meals.  Whether you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, making the right food choices is an important way to keep your blood glucose at a level that is healthy for you. When you control your blood glucose, you lower your chance of having serious health problems from diabetes, such as vision loss and heart problems.    And if you have prediabetes or are at risk for diabetes, eating foods that keep your blood glucose levels healthy may help prevent type 2 diabetes later on.    What's the best diet for diabetes? There isn't a specific diet or meal plan that works for everybody. Your health care provider may have you see a registered dietician (RD) or a diabetes educator who can help design the best eating plan for you. The plan will consider:   Any medicines that you take Your weight Any other health conditions you have Your lifestyle and tastes Your goals   All eating plans for diabetes have a few things in common, including eating the right foods in the right amounts at the right times.  What foods should I eat if I have diabetes? Eating the right foods for diabetes means eating a variety of healthy foods from all the food groups:   Fruits and vegetables Whole grains, such as whole wheat, brown rice, barley, quinoa, and oats Proteins, such as lean meats, chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, nuts, beans, lentils, and tofu Nonfat or low-fat dairy, such as milk, yogurt, and cheese   What foods should I limit to control my blood glucose? To keep your blood glucose under control, you may need to cut back on certain foods and drinks. This doesn't mean that you can never enjoy them. But you should have them less often or in smaller amounts.   The foods and drinks you should limit include:   High-carb foods and drinks, such as: \t \t\tSugary foods, such as candy, cookies, cake, ice cream, sweetened cereals, and canned fruits with added sugar \t\tDrinks with added sugars, such as juice, regular soda, and regular sports or energy drinks \t\tWhite rice, tortillas, breads, and pasta - especially those made with white flour \t\tStarchy vegetables, such as white potatoes, corn, and peas \t  Fried foods and other foods high in saturated and trans fats. Foods high in sodium (salt). Alcohol. If you do drink, you should drink moderately. This means no more than one standard drink a day if you're a woman or two standard drinks a day if you're a man.   What else do I need to know about diabetic diets? If you have diabetes, it's important to eat the right amount of food every day. Your eating plan will include how much to eat, and help you choose the types of food for each meal or snack. If you take insulin, you may need to learn how to count carbs to help you know how much insulin to take.  Eating at the right times is also important. You will want to plan for regular, balanced meals to avoid blood glucose levels that are too high or too low for you. Eating about the same amount of carbs at each meal can be helpful.  Your eating plan will also teach you how to stick with your plan at home and when you eat out.  Eating healthy to control your blood glucose does take some effort. But the reward is a chance to live your healthiest life with diabetes.   NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

    "summary": "What is diabetes? Diabetes is a disease in which your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are too high. Glucose comes from foods you eat. The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.   With type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood glucose levels.   What eye problems can diabetes cause? Over time, high blood glucose may damage the blood vessels and lenses in your eyes. This can lead to serious diabetic eye problems which can harm your vision and sometimes cause blindness. Some common diabetic eye problems include:  Diabetic retinopathy, which is the leading cause of blindness in American adults. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light-sensitive layer of tissue in the back of your eye). The blood vessels may swell and leak fluid into your eye. If it's not treated, it can cause serious problems such as vision loss and retinal detachment, where the retina is pulled away from its normal position at the back of your eye. Diabetic macular edema (DME), which happens when blood vessels in the retina leak fluid into the macula (the part of the retina needed for sharp, central vision). This usually develops in people who already have other signs of diabetic retinopathy. Glaucoma, a group of eye diseases that can damage the optic nerve (the bundle of nerves that connects the eye to the brain). Glaucoma from diabetes happens when the blood vessels in the front of your eye are damaged, and new blood vessels grow near the iris (the colored part of your eye). The blood vessels block the space where fluid drains from your eye. This causes fluid to build up and pressure to increase inside your eye. Cataract, which is the leading cause of blindness worldwide. It happens when the clear lens in the front of your eye becomes cloudy. Cataracts are common as people age. But people with diabetes are more likely to develop cataracts younger and faster than people without diabetes. Researchers think that high glucose levels cause deposits to build up in the lenses of your eyes.      Who is more likely to develop diabetic eye problems? Anyone with diabetes can develop diabetic eye disease. But your risk of developing it is higher if you have diabetes and:  Have had diabetes for a long time Don't have good control over your high blood glucose or high blood pressure Are pregnant Have high blood cholesterol Smoke tobacco   What are the symptoms of diabetic eye problems?  In the early stages, diabetic eye problems usually don't have any symptoms. That's why regular dilated eye exams are so important, even if you think your eyes are healthy. You should also watch for sudden changes in your vision that could be signs of an emergency. Call your eye care professional right away if you notice any of these symptoms:  Many new spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision (floaters) Flashes of light A dark shadow over part of your vision, like a curtain Vision loss Eye pain or redness  Talk with your eye care professional if you have these symptoms, even if they come and go:  Spots or dark wavy strings floating in your vision Blurry or wavy vision Vision that changes a lot Trouble seeing colors    How are diabetic eye problems diagnosed? Eye care professionals do dilated eye exams to diagnose eye problems. A dilated eye exam uses eye drops to open your pupils wide so your eye care professional can look for signs of eye problems and treat them before they harm your vision. They will also test your vision and measure the pressure in your eyes.  What are the treatments for diabetic eye problems? Treatment for diabetic eye problems depends on the problem and how serious it is. Some of the treatments include:  Lasers to stop blood vessels from leaking Injections (shots) in the eye to stop new, leaky blood vessels from growing Surgery to remove blood and scar tissue or replace a cloudy lens Eye drops to lower fluid pressure in the eye  But these treatments aren't cures. Eye problems can come back. That's why your best defense against serious vision loss is to take control of your diabetes and get regular eye exams. It's also important to keep your blood pressure and cholesterol in a healthy range.  NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

The cells of your body need glucose for energy. A hormone called insulin helps the glucose get into your cells.  With type 1 diabetes, your body doesn't make insulin. With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make or use insulin well. Without enough insulin, glucose can't get into your cells as quickly as usual. The glucose builds up in your blood and causes high blood sugar levels.   How does diabetes cause foot problems?  Foot problems are common in people with diabetes. They can happen over time when high blood sugar damages the nerves and blood vessels in the feet. The nerve damage, called diabetic neuropathy, can cause numbness, tingling, pain, or a loss of feeling in your feet.  If you can't feel pain, you may not know when you have a cut, blister, or ulcer (open sore) on your foot. A wound like that could get infected. The infection may not heal well because the damaged blood vessels can cause poor blood flow in your feet. Having an infection and poor blood flow can lead to gangrene. That means the muscle, skin, and other tissues start to die. If you have gangrene or a foot ulcer that does not get better with treatment, you may need an amputation. This is a surgery to cut off your damaged toe, foot, or part of your leg. It may prevent a bad infection from spreading and could save your life. But there's a lot you can do to prevent a foot wound from becoming a major health problem.  How can I protect my feet if I have diabetes? The best way to protect your feet is by controlling your blood sugar levels every day. This will help keep nerve and blood vessel damage from getting worse. The next step is to keep the skin of your feet healthy.  Good foot care for people with diabetes includes:  Checking your feet every day. Look for cuts, redness, and other changes in the skin and toenails, including warts or other spots that your shoes could rub. Make sure to check the bottoms of your feet too. Washing your feet every day. Use warm water and soap. Don't soak your feet because that can dry out your skin. After you dry your feet, you can use talcum powder or cornstarch between your toes. They soak up moisture that can cause infection. If you use lotion, don't apply it between your toes.  Asking your doctor how to remove corns and calluses safely. Thick skin on your feet can rub and lead to sores. But removing it the wrong way could damage your skin. So you don't want to cut the skin or use medicated pads or liquid removers.  Trimming your toenails straight across with a clipper. If it's hard for you to trim your own toenails, or if they're thick or curve into the skin, have a podiatrist (foot doctor) do it for you. Always wearing well-fitting shoes and socks or slippers to protect your feet when walking. You don't want to walk barefoot, even indoors. And be sure your shoes are smooth inside. A seam or pebble could rub your skin raw. Protecting your feet from heat and cold. Use sunscreen on exposed skin and don't walk barefoot at the beach. In cold weather, wear warm socks instead of warming your feet near a heater or fireplace. Keeping the blood flowing in your feet. Put your feet up when you're sitting. Wiggle your toes and circle your feet throughout the day. Don't wear tight socks. And get plenty of activity that's not too hard on the feet, such as walking.  Getting your feet checked at your health care visits. Even if you haven't noticed a problem, it's good to have your health care provider look at your feet.   When should I see my health care provider about diabetic foot problems? Serious foot problems can develop quickly. See your health care provider right away if you notice:  A cut, blister, or bruise on your feet that doesn't start to heal in a few days Red, warm, or painful skin on your feet A callus with dried blood inside A foot infection that becomes black and smells bad that could be gangrene  Remember, controlling your blood sugar and caring for your feet every day are the best steps you can take to prevent serious diabetic foot problems.

Diabetic heart disease is a term for heart disease in people who have diabetes. If you have diabetes, you are much more likely to develop heart disease or have a stroke than people who don't have diabetes. And you may start having these problems at a younger age. Over time, the effects of high blood sugar from diabetes can include damage to the blood vessels and nerves in your heart. This damage increases your chance of developing heart diseases, including:  Coronary artery disease (CAD). It happens slowly as a sticky material called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood.  Heart failure. With this condition, your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet the needs of your body.  Cardiomyopathy. This is a group of diseases in which the heart muscle may become thick or stiff.     Who is more likely to develop diabetic heart disease? Diabetes puts you at serious risk for heart disease.

They might include:  Shortness of breath Fatigue Dizziness or fainting Arrhythmia (problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Swollen feet and ankles Chest pain  It's important to know that people with diabetes may not feel chest pain. That's because diabetes can damage the nerves in your heart. If you have any symptoms that could be heart disease, talk with your health care provider.   How is diabetic heart disease diagnosed? To find out if you have diabetic heart disease, your provider will:  Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms and other health conditions you may have Ask about your family history, to find out if you have relatives who have or had heart disease Do a physical exam Likely run some tests to help understand your personal risk for heart disease, including: \t \t\tBlood tests to check your cholesterol, triglycerides, and blood sugar levels    \t\tA blood-pressure check  \t\tHeart tests, if needed \t   Depending on your risk level, your provider may send you to a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) for care. If you do have heart disease, treatment will depend on the type of heart disease you have.  How can I prevent diabetic heart disease? You may be able to prevent heart disease or keep it from getting worse by working with your provider to:  Control your blood sugar levels  Manage other conditions you may have that can raise your risk for heart disease  Take any medicines your provider prescribed Make heart-healthy habits part of your daily life Follow a healthy eating plan for diabetes  NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

    "disease": "Diarrhea",
    "summary": "What is diarrhea? Diarrhea is loose, watery stools (bowel movements). You have diarrhea if you have loose stools three or more times in one day. Acute diarrhea is diarrhea that lasts a short time. It is a common problem.  It usually lasts about one or two days, but it may last longer. Then it goes away on its own.  Diarrhea lasting more than a few days may be a sign of a more serious problem. Chronic diarrhea -- diarrhea that lasts at least four weeks -- can be a symptom of a chronic disease. Chronic diarrhea symptoms may be continual, or they may come and go.  What causes diarrhea? The most common causes of diarrhea include: Bacteria from contaminated food or water Viruses such as the flu, norovirus, or rotavirus . Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea in children. Parasites, which are tiny organisms found in contaminated food or water Medicines such as antibiotics, cancer drugs, and antacids that contain magnesium Food intolerances and sensitivities, which are problems digesting certain ingredients or foods. An example is lactose intolerance. Diseases that affect the stomach, small intestine, or colon, such as Crohn's disease Problems with how the colon functions, such as irritable bowel syndrome   Some people also get diarrhea after stomach surgery, because sometimes the surgeries can cause food to move through your digestive system more quickly.  Sometimes no cause can be found. If your diarrhea goes away within a few days, finding the cause is usually not necessary.  Who is at risk for diarrhea? People of all ages can get diarrhea. On average, adults In the United States have acute diarrhea once a year. Young children have it an average of twice a year.  People who visit developing countries are at risk for traveler's diarrhea. It is caused by consuming contaminated food or water.  What other symptoms might I have with diarrhea? Other possible symptoms of diarrhea include: Cramps or pain in the abdomen An urgent need to use the bathroom Loss of bowel control   If a virus or bacteria is the cause of your diarrhea, you may also have a fever, chills, and bloody stools.  Diarrhea can cause dehydration, which means that your body does not have enough fluid to work properly. Dehydration can be serious, especially for children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems.  When do I need to see a health care provider for diarrhea? Although it is usually not harmful, diarrhea can become dangerous or signal a more serious problem. Contact your health care provider if you have: Signs of dehydration Diarrhea for more than 2 days, if you are an adult. For children, contact the provider if it lasts more than 24 hours. Severe pain in your abdomen or rectum (for adults) A fever of 102 degrees or higher Stools containing blood or pus Stools that are black and tarry   If children have diarrhea, parents or caregivers should not hesitate to call a health care provider. Diarrhea can be especially dangerous in newborns and infants.  How is the cause of diarrhea diagnosed? To find the cause of diarrhea, your health care provider may: Do a physical exam Ask about any medicines you are taking Test your stool or blood to look for bacteria, parasites, or other signs of disease or infection Ask you to stop eating certain foods to see whether your diarrhea goes away   If you have chronic diarrhea, your health care provider may perform other tests to look for signs of disease.  What are the treatments for diarrhea? Diarrhea is treated by replacing lost fluids and electrolytes to prevent dehydration. Depending on the cause of the problem, you may need medicines to stop the diarrhea or treat an infection.  Adults with diarrhea should drink water, fruit juices, sports drinks, sodas without caffeine, and salty broths. As your symptoms improve, you can eat soft, bland food.  Children with diarrhea should be given oral rehydration solutions to replace lost fluids and electrolytes.  Can diarrhea be prevented? Two types of diarrhea can be prevented - rotavirus diarrhea and traveler's diarrhea. There are vaccines for rotavirus. They are given to babies in two or three doses.  You can help prevent traveler's diarrhea by being careful about what you eat and drink when you are in developing countries: Use only bottled or purified water for drinking, making ice cubes, and brushing your teeth If you do use tap water, boil it or use iodine tablets Make sure that the cooked food you eat is fully cooked and served hot Avoid unwashed or unpeeled raw fruits and vegetables   NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

Causes of disabilities that are present at birth can include:  Disorders in single genes, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy Disorders of chromosomes, such as Down syndrome Exposures (before birth) to infections or substances, such as drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes   Causes of disabilities that happen later in life can include:  Injuries, such as spinal cord injuries, traumatic brain injuries (TBIs), and back injuries Chronic (long-lasting) diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, COPD, and arthritis Cancer Mental health problems Stroke Alzheimer's disease and other causes of dementia   How can disabilities affect your health? Having a disability does not mean a person cannot be healthy. In fact, many people with disabilities report that their health as good or better. But they may have or be at risk of health problems related to their disability, called \"secondary conditions.\" These conditions may include:  Bowel or bladder problems Chronic pain Diabetes Fatigue Heart disease Injuries Mental health problems, including depression and substance use disorders Overweight and obesity Pressure sores or ulcers   Many of these conditions can be prevented, and there are treatments for them. It's also important for people with disabilities to get health care that meets their needs as a whole person, not just as a person with a disability.  How can people with disabilities get and stay healthy? Just like for people who don't have a disability, having a healthy lifestyle is important for people who do have a disability. A healthy lifestyle includes:  Getting regular physical activity Eating healthy foods in healthy portions Limiting sun exposure and using sunscreen to prevent skin cancer Not smoking, and if needed, getting help to quit smoking Using medicines wisely Not drinking alcohol or drinking in moderation Getting help for any substance use or mental health problems Staying in touch with family and friends   What kinds of resources are there for people with disabilities?  Managing a disability can sometimes be challenging. There are resources that can help:  Assistive devices and mobility aids can make daily tasks easier. Schools can develop plans around the specific needs of a child with a disability. The goal of the plans is to give the child an opportunity to perform at the same level as other children their age. Support networks, such as disability organizations, can help you learn more about resources for you and your family. Support groups can help you connect with other people who have the same disability. They can provide emotional and social support. They are also a place where people can share tips about how to deal with day-to-day challenges. Government programs may provide benefits, job training, employment resources, and protection against discrimination.   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

    "disease": "Dislocated Shoulder",
    "summary": "What is a dislocated shoulder? Your shoulder joint is made up of three bones: your collarbone, your shoulder blade, and your upper arm bone. The top of your upper arm bone is shaped like a ball. This ball fits into a cuplike socket in your shoulder blade. A shoulder dislocation is an injury that happens when the ball pops out of your socket. A dislocation may be partial, where the ball is only partially out of the socket. It can also be a full dislocation, where the ball is completely out of the socket.  What causes a dislocated shoulder? Your shoulders are the most movable joints in your body. They are also the most commonly dislocated joints.  The most common causes of shoulder dislocations are: Sports injuries Accidents, including traffic accidents Falling on your shoulder or outstretched arm Seizures and electric shocks, which can cause muscle contractions that pull the arm out of place   Who is at risk for a dislocated shoulder? A dislocated shoulder can happen to anyone, but they are more common in young men, who are more often involved in sports and other physical activities. Older adults, especially women, are also at higher risk because they are more likely to fall.  What are the symptoms of a dislocated shoulder? The symptoms of a dislocated shoulder include: Severe shoulder pain Swelling and bruising of your shoulder or upper arm Numbness and/or weakness in your arm, neck, hand, or fingers Trouble moving your arm Your arm seems to be out of place Muscle spasms in your shoulder   If you are having these symptoms, get medical treatment right away.  How is a dislocated shoulder diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will take a medical history and examine your shoulder. Your provider may also ask you to get an x-ray to confirm the diagnosis.  What are the treatments for a dislocated shoulder? The treatment for dislocated shoulder usually involves three steps: The first step is a closed reduction, a procedure in which your health care provider puts the ball of your upper arm back into the socket. You may first get medicine to relieve the pain and relax your shoulder muscles. Once the joint is back in place, the severe pain should end. The second step is wearing a sling or other device to keep your shoulder in place. You will wear it for a few days to several weeks. The third step is rehabilitation, once the pain and swelling have improved. You will do exercises to improve your range of motion and strengthen your muscles.   You may need surgery if you injure the tissues or nerves around the shoulder or if you get repeated dislocations.   A dislocation can make your shoulder unstable. When that happens, it takes less force to dislocate it. This means that there is a higher risk of it happening again. Your health care provider may ask you to continue doing some exercises to prevent another dislocation.",

    "summary": "Dislocations are joint injuries that force the ends of your bones out of position. The cause is often a fall or a blow, sometimes from playing a contact sport. You can dislocate your ankles, knees, shoulders, hips, elbows and jaw. You can also dislocate your finger and toe joints. Dislocated joints often are swollen, very painful and visibly out of place. You may not be able to move it.  A dislocated joint is an emergency.  If you have one, seek medical attention. Treatment depends on which joint you dislocate and the severity of the injury. It might include manipulations to reposition your bones, medicine, a splint or sling, and rehabilitation. When properly repositioned, a joint will usually function and move normally again in a few weeks. Once you dislocate a shoulder or kneecap, you are more likely to dislocate it again. Wearing protective gear during sports may help prevent dislocations.",

    "disease": "Diverticulosis and Diverticulitis",
    "summary": "What is diverticulosis? Diverticula are small pouches, or sacs, that bulge outward through weak spots in your colon. They mostly form in the lower part of the colon. Diverticulosis is a condition in which you have these pouches. Most people who have diverticulosis do not have symptoms or problems. But sometimes the pouches can cause symptoms or become inflamed.  What is diverticulitis? Diverticulitis is the name for the condition you have when one or more of the pouches get inflamed. Diverticulitis may come on suddenly. It can sometimes cause serious health problems.  What is diverticular disease? Diverticular disease is a condition that happens when the pouches cause:  Chronic (long-term) symptoms Diverticular bleeding Diverticulitis or diverticulitis complications   What causes diverticulosis and diverticulitis? Researchers aren't sure what causes diverticulosis and diverticulitis. They think certain factors may play a role in causing or increasing the risk for these conditions, including:  Your genetics. Certain genes may make some people more likely to develop the conditions. Lifestyle factors such as:      Diets low in fiber and high in red meat   Lack of physical activity   Taking certain medicines, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroids   Having obesity   Smoking       Researchers are also looking at other possible factors that may play a role in these conditions. Those factors include bacteria or stool (poop) getting caught in a pouch in your colon and changes in the microbiome in the intestines. Your microbiome is made up of the bacteria and other organisms in your intestines.  Who is more likely to develop diverticulosis and diverticulitis? Diverticulosis is common, especially as people age. More than one-third of U.S. adults between the ages of 50 and 59 have diverticulosis. More than two-thirds who are over age 80 have it. Most of those people will not have symptoms or problems. But some of them will develop diverticulitis.  What are the symptoms of diverticulosis and diverticulitis? Diverticulosis usually doesn't cause symptoms. But some people can have chronic symptoms such as:  Bloating Constipation or diarrhea Cramping or painin the lower abdomen (belly)   Diverticulitis may cause acute symptoms such as:  Abdominal pain, most often in the lower left side of your abdomen Constipation or diarrhea Fevers and chills Nausea or vomiting   The pain caused by diverticulitis is usually severe and comes on suddenly. Less often, the pain may be mild and worsen over several days.  What other problems can diverticulosis and diverticulitis cause? Some people with diverticulosis and diverticulitis may develop serious health problems (complications). Diverticular bleeding happens when a small blood vessel within the wall of a pouch bursts. The bleeding may be severe and sometimes even life-threatening.  People with diverticulitis can also develop serious problems such as:  Abscess, a painful, swollen, pus-filled area caused by infection Fistula, an abnormal opening or passage between the colon and another part of the body, such as the bladder or vagina Intestinal obstruction, a partial or total blockage that keeps food, fluids, air, or stool from moving through your intestinesPerforation, or a hole, in your colon Peritonitis, an infection of the lining of the abdominal cavity   How are diverticulosis and diverticulitis diagnosed? Diverticulosis may be found when your health care provider is doing tests for another reason. Diverticulitis is usually found when you are having an acute attack.  To make a diagnosis, your provider will review your medical history, do a physical exam, and order tests. The tests may include:  Blood tests Stool tests Imaging tests such as CT scan, ultrasound, or MRI Colonoscopy   What are the treatments for diverticulosis and diverticulitis? If your diverticulosis is causing chronic symptoms, your provider may recommend:  High-fiber foods or fiber supplements Antibiotics Medicines to reduce inflammation Probiotics   If you have diverticulitis without complications, your provider may recommend treatment at home. However, you probably need treatment in the hospital if you have severe diverticulitis, diverticulitis with complications, or a high risk for complications.   Treatments for diverticulitis may include:  Antibiotics, except for very mild cases. A clear liquid diet for a short time to rest the colon. Your provider may suggest slowly adding solid foods to your diet as your symptoms improve. Medicines for pain. This is usually acetaminophen instead of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs may increase the chance of diverticulitis complications. Antispasmodic medicines to relieve spasms.   If your diverticulitis doesn't improve with treatment or if it causes complications, you may need surgery to remove part of your colon.  Can diverticulitis be prevented? Your provider may recommend lifestyle changes to prevent diverticulitis:  Eating a diet high in fiber and low in red meat Being physically active on a regular basis Not smoking (and quitting smoking if you are a smoker) Reaching and maintaining a healthy weight   NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

    "disease": "Down Syndrome",
    "summary": "What is Down syndrome?  Down syndrome is a condition in which a person has an extra chromosome or an extra piece of a chromosome. This extra copy changes how a baby's body and brain develop. It can cause both mental and physical challenges during their lifetime. Even though people with Down syndrome might act and look similar, each person has different abilities.  What causes Down syndrome? Chromosomes are tiny \"packages\" in your cells that contain your genes. Genes carry information, called DNA, that controls what you look like and how your body works. People with Down syndrome have an extra copy of chromosome 21.  In some cases, they may have an extra copy of part of the chromosome. Having an extra copy of a chromosome is called trisomy. So sometimes Down syndrome is also called trisomy 21.  Down syndrome is usually not inherited. It happens by chance, as an error when cells are dividing during early development of the fetus. It is not known for sure why Down syndrome occurs or how many different factors play a role.  One factor that increases the risk of having a baby with Down syndrome is the age of the mother. Women ages 35 and older are more likely to have a baby with Down syndrome.  What are the symptoms of Down syndrome? The symptoms of Down syndrome are different in each person. And people with Down syndrome may have different problems at different times of their lives. They usually have mild to moderate intellectual disabilities. Their development is often delayed. For example, they may start talking later than other children.   Some of the common physical signs of Down syndrome include:   A flat face Eyes that slant up A short neck Small hands and feet Poor muscle tone Loose joints   What other problems does Down syndrome cause? Many people with Down syndrome have the common physical signs and have healthy lives. But some people with Down syndrome might have one or more birth defects or other health problems. Some of the more common ones include:  Hearing loss Sleep apnea (a disorder that causes you to repeatedly stop breathing during sleep) Ear infections Eye diseases Congenital heart defects (heart defects that are present at birth) Digestive problems Problems with the upper part of the spine Obesity   How is Down syndrome diagnosed? Health care providers can check for Down syndrome during pregnancy or after a child is born.  There are two basic types of tests that help find Down syndrome during pregnancy:   Prenatal screening tests can show whether your unborn baby has a higher or lower chance of having Down syndrome. If a screening test shows that your baby could have Down syndrome, you'll need another test to find out for sure. Prenatal diagnostic tests can diagnose or rule out Down syndrome by checking the chromosomes in a sample of cells. These tests have a small risk of causing a miscarriage, so they're often done after a screening test shows that an unborn baby could have Down syndrome.   After a baby is born, the provider may make an initial diagnosis of Down syndrome based on the physical signs of the syndrome. The provider can use a karyotype genetic test to confirm the diagnosis. The test can check for extra chromosomes in a sample of the baby's blood.    What are the treatments for Down syndrome? There is no single, standard treatment for Down syndrome. Treatments are based on each person's physical and intellectual needs, strengths, and limitations.  Services early in life focus on helping children with Down syndrome develop to their full potential. These services include speech, occupational, and physical therapies. They are typically offered through early intervention programs in each state. Children with Down syndrome may also need extra help or attention in school, although many children are included in regular classes.  Since people with Down syndrome can have birth defects and other health problems, they will need regular medical care. They may need to have certain extra health screenings to check for problems that happen more often in people with Down syndrome.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

    "summary": "Most of the time, medicines make our lives better. They reduce aches and pains, fight infections, and control problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes. But medicines can also cause unwanted reactions, such as drug interactions, side effects, and allergies.  What is a drug interaction? A drug interaction is a change in the way a drug acts in the body when taken with certain other drugs, foods, or supplements or when taken while you have certain medical conditions. Examples include:  Two drugs, such as aspirin and blood thinners Drugs and food, such as statins and grapefruit Drugs and supplements, such as gingko and blood thinners Drugs and medical conditions, such as aspirin and peptic ulcers   Interactions could cause a drug to be more or less effective, cause side effects, or change the way one or both drugs work.  What are side effects? Side effects are unwanted, usually unpleasant, effects caused by medicines. Most are mild, such as a stomachache, dry mouth, or drowsiness, and go away after you stop taking the medicine.  Others can be more serious. Sometimes a drug can interact with a disease that you have and cause a side effect. For example, if you have a heart condition, certain decongestants can cause you to have a rapid heartbeat.  What are drug allergies? Drug allergies are another type of reaction. They can range from mild to life-threatening. Skin reactions, such as hives and rashes, are the most common type. Anaphylaxis, a serious allergic reaction, is less common.  How can I stay safe when taking medicines? When you start a new prescription or over-the-counter medicine, make sure you understand how to take it correctly. Know which other medicines, foods, and supplements you need to avoid.

They include prescription medicines, over-the-counter medicines, alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs.  What is drug use? Drug use, or misuse, includes:  Using illegal substances, such as: \t \t\tAnabolic steroids \t\tClub drugs \t\tCocaine \t\tHeroin \t\tInhalants \t\tMarijuana \t\tMethamphetamines \t  Misusing prescription medicines, including opioids.

Drug use is dangerous. It can harm your brain and body, sometimes permanently. It can hurt the people around you, including friends, families, and kids. If you are pregnant, it can harm your fetus. Drug use can also lead to mild, moderate, or severe substance use disorders. Substance use disorders are sometimes called addiction.   What is drug addiction? Drug addiction is a chronic brain disease. It causes a person to take drugs repeatedly, despite the harm they cause. Repeated drug use can change the brain and lead to addiction.   The brain changes from addiction can be lasting, so drug addiction is considered a \"relapsing\" disease. This means that people in recovery are at risk for taking drugs again, even after years of not taking them.  Does everyone who takes drugs become addicted? Not everyone who uses drugs becomes addicted. Everyone's bodies and brains are different, so their reactions to drugs can also be different. Some people may become addicted quickly, or it may happen over time. Other people never become addicted. Whether or not someone becomes addicted depends on many factors. They include genetic, environmental, and developmental factors.  Who is at risk for drug addiction? Various risk factors can make you more likely to become addicted to drugs, including:  Your biology. People can react to drugs differently. Some people like the feeling the first time they try a drug and want more. Others hate how it feels and never try it again.  Mental health problems. People who have untreated mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety, or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are more likely to become addicted. This can happen because drug use and mental health problems affect the same parts of the brain. Also, people with these problems may use drugs to try to feel better.  Trouble at home. If your home is an unhappy place or was when you were growing up, you might be more likely to have a drug problem.   Trouble in school, at work, or with making friends. You might use drugs to get your mind off these problems.  Hanging around other people who use drugs. They might encourage you to try drugs.  Starting drug use when you're young. When kids use drugs, it affects how their bodies and brains finish growing. This increases your chances of becoming addicted when you're an adult.    What are the signs that someone has a drug problem? Signs that someone has a drug problem include:  Changing friends a lot Spending a lot of time alone Losing interest in favorite things Not taking care of themselves - for example, not taking showers, changing clothes, or brushing their teeth Being very energetic, talking fast, or saying things that don't make sense Quickly changing between feeling bad and feeling good Having different eating or sleeping habits Missing important appointments Having problems at work or at school Having problems in personal or family relationships   What are the treatments for drug addiction? Treatments for drug addiction include counseling, medicines, or both. Research shows that combining medicines with counseling gives most people the best chance of success.  The counseling may be individual, family, and/or group therapy. It can help you:  Understand why the drug addiction began See how drugs changed your behavior Learn how to manage personal problems Learn to avoid places, people, and situations where drugs are accessible   If you stop or cut back on drugs you've used for a while, you may display different symptoms for different drugs. This is called withdrawal. Medicines can help with the symptoms of withdrawal. For addiction to certain drugs, there are also medicines that can help you re-establish normal brain function and decrease your cravings.  If you have a mental disorder along with an addiction, it is known as a dual diagnosis. It is important to treat both problems. This will increase your chance of success.  If you have a severe addiction, you may need hospital-based or residential treatment. Residential treatment programs combine housing and treatment services.  Can drug use and addiction be prevented? Drug use and addiction are preventable. Prevention programs involving families, schools, communities, and the media may prevent or reduce drug use and addiction. These programs include education and outreach to help people understand the risks of drug use.  NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse",

Why are drugs especially dangerous for young people? Young people's brains are growing and developing until they are their mid-20's. This is especially true of the prefrontal cortex, which is used to make decisions. Taking drugs when young can interfere with developmental processes occurring in the brain. It can also affect their decision-making. They may be more likely to do risky things, such as unsafe sex and dangerous driving.  The earlier young people start using drugs, the greater their chances of continuing to use them and become addicted later in life.Taking drugs when you are young can contribute to the development of adult health problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and sleep disorders.  Which drugs most commonly used by young people? The drugs that are most commonly used by young people are alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana. Recently, more young people have started vaping tobacco and marijuana. There is still a lot we don't know about the dangers of vaping. Some people have unexpectedly gotten very ill or have even died after vaping. Because of this, young people should stay away from vaping.  Why do young people take drugs? There are many different reasons why a young person may take drugs, including: To fit in. Young people may do drugs because they want to be accepted by friends or peers who are doing drugs. To feel good. Abused drugs can produce feelings of pleasure.  To feel better. Some young people suffer from depression, anxiety, stress-related disorders, and physical pain. They may do drugs to try to get some relief. To do better in academics or sports. Some young people may take stimulants for studying or anabolic steroids to improve their athletic performance. To experiment. Young people often want to try new experiences, especially ones that they think are thrilling or daring.   Which young people are at risk for drug use? Different factors may raise a young person's risk for drug use, including: Stressful early life experiences, such child abuse, child sexual abuse, and other forms of trauma Genetics Prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs Lack of parental supervision or monitoring Having peers and/or friends who use drugs   What are the signs that a young person has a drug problem?  Changing friends a lot Spending a lot of time alone Losing interest in favorite things Not taking care of themselves - for example, not taking showers, changing clothes, or brushing their teeth Being really tired and sad Eating more or eating less than usual Being very energetic, talking fast, or saying things that don't make sense Being in a bad mood Quickly changing between feeling bad and feeling good Missing important appointments Having problems at school - missing class, getting bad grades Having problems in personal or family relationships Lying and stealing Memory lapses, poor concentration, lack of coordination, slurred speech, etc.   Can drug use in young people be prevented? Drug use and addiction are preventable. Prevention programs involving families, schools, communities, and the media may prevent or reduce drug use and addiction. These programs include education and outreach to help people understand the risks of drug use.

For example:  It moistens and breaks down the foods you eat, which makes it easier for you to chew and swallow. It washes away small food pieces from your teeth and gums, which helps fight against tooth decay. It contains minerals such as calcium and phosphate, which can also help fight tooth decay. It contains antibodies that can fight against infections of the mouth and throat. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight foreign substances such as viruses and bacteria.

There are many possible causes of dry mouth, including:  Side effects of certain medicines, such as some medicines for high blood pressure, depression, and bladder-control issues Diseases such as Sjogren's syndrome, HIV, salivary gland disorders, and diabetes Radiation therapy, which can damage your salivary glands if they are exposed to radiation during the treatment Chemotherapy, which can make your saliva thicker and cause your mouth to feel dry Nerve damage, when it involves the nerves that tell salivary glands to make saliva Breathing through your mouth Use of alcohol, tobacco, or other substances   What are the symptoms of dry mouth? The symptoms of dry mouth may include:  A sticky, dry feeling in your mouth Trouble chewing, swallowing, tasting, or speaking A burning feeling in your mouth A dry feeling in your throat Cracked lips A dry, rough tongue Mouth sores An infection in your mouth Bad breath   How is the cause of dry mouth diagnosed? If you have dry mouth, it's important to find out the cause. To do that, your health care provider or dentist will review your medical history, examine your mouth, and ask about any medicines you take. They may also suggest blood tests or a test that measures how much saliva you produce.  What are the treatments for dry mouth? Treatment for dry mouth depends on the cause. For example, if a medicine is causing dry mouth, your provider or dentist may suggest adjusting the dosage or switching medicines. In some cases, they might give you artificial saliva or a medicine to help your salivary glands work better.  There are also several things you can do to help relieve your symptoms:  Drink plenty of water Avoid drinks with caffeine, which can dry out your mouth Chew sugarless gum or suck on sugarless hard candy to stimulate saliva flow Avoid spicy or salty foods because they can cause pain if your mouth is dry Avoid alcohol and tobacco Using a humidifier at night Use a mouthwash made for dry mouth   Since dry mouth can raise your risk of tooth decay, it's important to brush and floss your teeth regularly and see your dentist at least twice a year.

    "disease": "Dual Diagnosis",
    "summary": "What is dual diagnosis? If you have a dual diagnosis, that means that you have both a mental disorder and a substance use disorder (SUD), either with alcohol or drugs. A dual diagnosis is a type of comorbidity, which is when someone has two disorders at the same time. Another name for this is co-occurring disorders.  Mental and substance use disorders often occur together. Many people who develop SUDs are also diagnosed with mental disorders. And the reverse is true; many people with mental disorders will develop an SUD. Having both types of disorders is even more common in teenagers, people with serious mental illness, and people with certain mental disorders.  Why do substance use disorders and mental disorders occur together? Although these problems often occur together, this does not mean that one caused the other, even if one appeared first. In fact, it can be hard to figure out which came first. Researchers think that there are three possible reasons as to why they often occur together:   Common risk factors can contribute to both mental disorders and SUDs. These factors include:      Genetics.   Stress.   Trauma, especially in childhood. Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also at risk for SUDs   Mental disorders can contribute to drug use and SUDs. For example, people with mental disorders may use drugs or alcohol to try to feel better temporarily. This is known as self-medication. Also, mental disorders may change the brain to make it more likely that you will become addicted. Substance use and addiction can contribute to the development of a mental disorder. Substance use may change the brain in ways that make you more likely to develop a mental disorder.   What are the treatments for dual diagnosis? If you have a dual diagnosis, it is usually better to treat both conditions at the same time rather than separately. You and your health care provider can work on a treatment plan that fits your needs.The plan should take into account your age, which substance(s) you are misusing, and which specific mental disorder(s) you have. The plan may include:  Behavioral therapy, such as talk therapy (psychotherapy), long-term residential treatment (which combines housing and treatment services), and therapies to help you stay motivated to stick with your treatment plan. Medicines. There are effective medicines that treat opioid, alcohol, and nicotine addiction. There are also medicines that can lessen the symptoms of many mental disorders. Some medicines may treat more than one disorder. A referral to a support group. Support groups can give you emotional and social support. They are also a place where people can share tips about how to deal with day-to-day challenges.   NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse",

    "summary": "What are eating disorders?  Eating disorders are serious mental health disorders. They involve severe problems with your thoughts about food and your eating behaviors. You may eat much less or much more than you need.  Eating disorders are medical conditions; they are not a lifestyle choice. They affect your body's ability to get proper nutrition. This can lead to health issues, such as heart and kidney problems, or sometimes even death. But there are treatments that can help.  What are the types of eating disorders? Common types of eating disorders include: Binge-eating, which is out-of-control eating. People with binge-eating disorder keep eating even after they are full. They often eat until they feel very uncomfortable. Afterward, they usually have feelings of guilt, shame, and distress. Eating too much too often can lead to weight gain and obesity. Binge-eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in the U.S. Bulimia nervosa. People with bulimia nervosa also have periods of binge-eating. But afterwards, they purge, by making themselves throw up or using laxatives. They may also over-exercise or fast. People with bulimia nervosa may be slightly underweight, normal weight, or overweight. Anorexia nervosa. People with anorexia nervosa avoid food, severely restrict food, or eat very small quantities of only certain foods. They may see themselves as overweight, even when they are dangerously underweight. Anorexia nervosa is the least common of the three eating disorders, but it is often the most serious. It has the highest death rate of any mental disorder.   What causes eating disorders? The exact cause of eating disorders is unknown. Researchers believe that eating disorders are caused by a complex interaction of factors. These include genetic, biological, behavioral, psychological, and social factors.  Who is at risk for eating disorders? Anyone can develop an eating disorder, but they are more common in women. Eating disorders frequently appear during the teen years or young adulthood. But people can also develop them during childhood or later in life.  What are the symptoms of eating disorders? The symptoms of eating disorders vary, depending on the disorder:  The symptoms of binge-eating include: Eating unusually large amounts of food in a specific amount of time, such as a 2-hour period Eating even when you're full or not hungry Eating fast during binge episodes Eating until you're uncomfortably full Eating alone or in secret to avoid embarrassment Feeling distressed, ashamed, or guilty about your eating Frequently dieting, possibly without weight loss   The symptoms of bulimia nervosa include the same symptoms as binge-eating, plus trying to get rid of the food or weight after binging by: Purging, making yourself throw up or using laxatives or enemas to speed up the movement of food through your body Doing intensive and excessive exercise Fasting   Over time, bulimia nervosa can cause health problems such as: Chronically inflamed and sore throat Swollen salivary glands in the neck and jaw area Worn tooth enamel and increasingly sensitive and decaying teeth. This is caused by the exposure to stomach acid every time you throw up. GERD (acid reflux) and other gastrointestinal problems Severe dehydration from purging Electrolyte imbalance, which could be too low or too high levels of sodium, calcium, potassium and other minerals. This can lead to a stroke or heart attack.   The symptoms of anorexia nervosa include: Eating very little, to the point of starving yourself Intensive and excessive exercise Extreme thinness Intense fear of gaining weight Distorted body image - seeing yourself as overweight even when you are severely underweight   Over time, anorexia nervosa can cause health problems such as: Thinning of the bones (osteopenia or osteoporosis) Mild anemia Muscle wasting and weakness Thin, brittle hair and nails Dry, blotchy, or yellowish skin Growth of fine hair all over the body Severe constipation Low blood pressure Slowed breathing and pulse Feeling cold all the time because of a drop in internal body temperature Feeling faint, dizzy, or weak Feeling tired all the time Infertility Damage to the structure and function of the heart Brain damage Multiorgan failure   Anorexia nervosa can be fatal. Some people with this disorder die of complications from starvation, and others die of suicide.  Some people with eating disorders may also have other mental disorders (such as depression or anxiety) or problems with substance use.  How is eating disorders diagnosed? Because eating disorders can be so serious, it is important to seek help if you or a loved one thinks that you might have a problem. Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. It is important to be honest about your eating and exercise behaviors so your provider can help you. A physical exam Blood or urine tests to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms Other tests to see whether you have any other health problems caused by the eating disorder. These can include kidney function tests and an electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG).   What are the treatments for eating disorders? Treatment plans for eating disorders are tailored to individual needs. You will likely have a team of providers helping you, including doctors, nutritionists, nurses, and therapists. The treatments may include: Individual, group, and/or family psychotherapy. Individual therapy may include cognitive behavioral approaches, which help you to identify and change negative and unhelpful thoughts. It also helps you build coping skills and change behavioral patterns. Medical care and monitoring, including care for the complications that eating disorders can cause Nutrition counseling. Doctors, nurses, and counselors will help you eat healthy to reach and maintain a healthy weight. Medicines, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, or mood stabilizers, may help treat some eating disorders. The medicines can also help with the depression and anxiety symptoms that often go along with eating disorders.   Some people with serious eating disorders may need to be in a hospital or in a residential treatment program. Residential treatment programs combine housing and treatment services.

    "disease": "Ebola",
    "summary": "What is Ebola? Ebola, also known as Ebola virus disease (EVD), is a type of hemorrhagic fever. It is a rare and often deadly disease. It can be caused by several different types of Ebola viruses. There are occasional outbreaks of Ebola, and they mostly occur in Africa.  How does Ebola spread? Researchers believe that the virus first spreads from an infected animal to a human. Ebola can then spread from human to human through direct contact with:  Blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola. Objects (such as clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment) contaminated with body fluids from a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola. Semen (through oral, vaginal, or anal sex) from a man who has recovered from Ebola. The virus can remain in semen and other body fluids, even if the person no longer has symptoms.   When people become infected with Ebola, they do not start developing signs or symptoms right away. They cannot spread Ebola to others until after they develop symptoms.  What are the symptoms of Ebola? The symptoms of Ebola may appear anywhere from 2 to 21 days after exposure to the virus. The average is about 8 to 10 days. The symptoms usually include:  Fever Headache Joint and muscle aches Weakness and fatigue Sore throat Gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal (belly) pain, diarrhea, and vomiting Loss of appetite Unexplained bleeding or bruising   Other symptoms may include a rash, red eyes, and hiccups.  How is Ebola diagnosed? The early symptoms of Ebola are similar to other more common diseases. This makes it difficult to diagnose Ebola in someone who has been infected for only a few days. If a person has the symptoms of Ebola and may have been exposed to the virus, the health care provider can do a blood test for Ebola. It can take a few days after the symptoms start before Ebola shows up in the blood test.  What are the treatments for Ebola? In the United States, there are two approved medicines to treat Ebola that is caused by one specific type of virus (Zaire ebolavirus). These medicines have not been evaluated to treat Ebola caused by other types of Ebola viruses. The medicines are monoclonal antibodies, which are immune system proteins that are created in the lab.    Whether or not there are medicines to treat a case of Ebola, there is supportive care. This type of care can improve the chances of survival, especially when given early. Supportive care includes:  Giving fluids and electrolytes Giving medicines to support blood pressure, reduce vomiting and diarrhea, and to manage fever and pain Giving oxygen Treating any other complications or infections   People who recover may still have side effects afterwards, such as fatigue, muscle aches, eye and vision problems, and stomach pain.  Can Ebola be prevented? In the United States, there is one vaccine that has been approved to prevent Ebola caused by one specific type of Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus). It may be given to health care providers who will be or may be treating Ebola patients and people who work with live Ebola virus in labs.  If you live in or plan to travel to a region where Ebola virus may be present, you can help protect yourself by avoiding contact with:  Blood and body fluids of people who are sick Semen from a man who has recovered from Ebola, until testing shows that the virus is gone from his semen Items that could be contaminated with blood or body fluids from someone who has Ebola Bats, forest antelopes, and nonhuman primates (such as monkeys and chimpanzees), including their blood, fluids, or meat    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

    "disease": "Ectopic Pregnancy",
    "summary": "What is an ectopic pregnancy? The uterus, or womb, is the place where a fetus grows during pregnancy.  In an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg grows in the wrong place outside the uterus. It usually occurs in the fallopian tubes. These tubes carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. Sometimes, an ectopic pregnancy can occur in the ovaries, abdominal cavity, or the lower part of the uterus (cervix).   Ectopic pregnancies can't end in a healthy pregnancy because the egg cannot grow. If the pregnancy continues, the fallopian tube can burst. This can cause internal bleeding, which can be a life-threatening emergency that needs immediate surgery.   What increases my risk of an ectopic pregnancy? An ectopic pregnancy often happens because there is a problem with your fallopian tubes. But sometimes it's not clear why an ectopic pregnancy happens.  Factors that may increase your risk for an ectopic pregnancy can include:  Previous ectopic pregnancy Prior pelvic, abdominal, or fallopian tube surgery  Certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Pelvic inflammatory disease  Endometriosis  Becoming pregnant while using an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control Becoming pregnant after a tubal ligation    Other factors that may increase your risk can include:  Smoking Being older than age 35  Infertility treatments   What are the symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy? You may not notice any symptoms at first. Or you may have some of the usual signs of pregnancy such as a missed period, breast tenderness, or nausea.  Early signs of an ectopic pregnancy may be light vaginal bleeding and pelvic pain. Ectopic pregnancy can be a medical emergency. Get medical care right away if you have these signs:  Abdominal (belly) pain Shoulder pain Vaginal bleeding Feeling dizzy or faint   How is an ectopic pregnancy diagnosed? An ectopic pregnancy can't be diagnosed without blood tests and an ultrasound. Your health care provider will do a pregnancy test to confirm that you're pregnant. They may do a pelvic exam to check for areas of pain, tenderness, or a mass.   What is the treatment for an ectopic pregnancy? An ectopic pregnancy needs treatment to stop any damage to your organs. Your provider will use medicine or surgery to take out the ectopic tissue.  Losing a pregnancy can be devastating. An ectopic pregnancy is like a miscarriage, but it must be treated to prevent problems. People cope with grief in different ways. It may be helpful to discuss your feelings with your provider or a counselor. Many women who have had ectopic pregnancies go on to have healthy pregnancies later.

    "disease": "Emphysema",
    "summary": "What is emphysema?  Emphysema is a type of COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). COPD is a group of lung diseases that make it hard to breathe and get worse over time. The other main type of COPD is chronic bronchitis. Most people with COPD have both emphysema and chronic bronchitis, but how severe each type is can be different from person to person. Emphysema affects the air sacs in your lungs. Normally, these sacs are elastic or stretchy. When you breathe in, each air sac fills up with air, like a small balloon. When you breathe out, the air sacs deflate, and the air goes out.  In emphysema, the walls between many of the air sacs in the lungs are damaged. This causes the air sacs to lose their shape and become floppy. The damage also can destroy the walls of the air sacs, leading to fewer and larger air sacs instead of many tiny ones. This makes it harder for your lungs to move oxygen in and carbon dioxide out of your body.  What causes emphysema? The cause of emphysema is usually long-term exposure to irritants that damage your lungs and the airways. In the United States, cigarette smoke is the main cause. Pipe, cigar, and other types of tobacco smoke can also cause emphysema, especially if you inhale them.  Exposure to other inhaled irritants can contribute to emphysema. These include secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes or dusts from the environment or workplace. Rarely, a genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency can play a role in causing emphysema.  Who is at risk for emphysema? The risk factors for emphysema include: Smoking. This the main risk factor. Up to 75% of people who have emphysema smoke or used to smoke.  Long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, and chemical fumes and dusts from the environment or workplace. Age. Most people who have emphysema are at least 40 years old when their symptoms begin.  Genetics. This includes alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition. Also, smokers who get emphysema are more likely to get it if they have a family history of COPD.   What are the symptoms of emphysema? At first, you may have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms usually become more severe. They can include: Frequent coughing or wheezing A cough that produces a lot mucus Shortness of breath, especially with physical activity A whistling or squeaky sound when you breathe Tightness in your chest   Some people with emphysema get frequent respiratory infections such as colds and the flu. In severe cases, emphysema can cause weight loss, weakness in your lower muscles, and swelling in your ankles, feet, or legs.  How is emphysema diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A family history Other tests, such as lung function tests, a chest x-ray or CT scan, and blood tests    What are the treatments for emphysema? There is no cure for emphysema. However, treatments can help with symptoms, slow the progress of the disease, and improve your ability to stay active. There are also treatments to prevent or treat complications of the disease. Treatments include: Lifestyle changes, such as \t \t\tQuitting smoking if you are a smoker. This is the most important step you can take to treat emphysema. \t\tAvoiding secondhand smoke and places where you might breathe in other lung irritants \t\tAsk your health care provider for an eating plan that will meet your nutritional needs. Also ask about how much physical activity you can do. Physical activity can strengthen the muscles that help you breathe and improve your overall wellness. \t  Medicines, such as \t \t\tBronchodilators, which relax the muscles around your airways. This helps open your airways and makes breathing easier. Most bronchodilators are taken through an inhaler. In more severe cases, the inhaler may also contain steroids to reduce inflammation. \t\tVaccines for the flu and pneumococcal pneumonia, since people with emphysema are at higher risk for serious problems from these diseases \t\tAntibiotics if you get a bacterial or viral lung infection \t  Oxygen therapy, if you have severe emphysema and low levels of oxygen in your blood. Oxygen therapy can help you breathe better. You may need extra oxygen all the time or only at certain times. Pulmonary rehabilitation, which is a program that helps improve the well-being of people who have chronic breathing problems. It may include \t \t\tAn exercise program \t\tDisease management training \t\tNutritional counseling \t\tPsychological counseling \t  Surgery, usually as a last resort for people who have severe symptoms that have not gotten better with medicines. There are surgeries to  \t \t\tRemove damaged lung tissue \t\tRemove large air spaces (bullae) that can form when air sacs are destroyed. The bullae can interfere with breathing. \t\tDo a lung transplant. This is might be an option if you have very severe emphysema. \t    If you have emphysema, it's important to know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You should get emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. Call your health care provider if your symptoms are getting worse or if you have signs of an infection, such as a fever.  Can emphysema be prevented? Since smoking causes most cases of emphysema, the best way to prevent it is to not smoke. It's also important to try to avoid lung irritants such as secondhand smoke, air pollution, chemical fumes, and dusts.  NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "disease": "Encephalitis",
    "summary": "What is encephalitis?  Encephalitis is inflammation (swelling) of the brain. It can happen when an infection or medical condition that affects the brain activates your immune system. The inflammation can cause a wide range of symptoms. In extreme cases, it can lead to brain damage, stroke, or even death.  What causes encephalitis? There are different types of encephalitis, based on what the cause is. The two main types are infectious encephalitis and autoimmune encephalitis.  Infectious encephalitis is usually caused by a virus. In fact, viruses are the most common cause of encephalitis. Some of the different viruses that cause it include: Herpes viruses, including herpes simplex (HSV), the Epstein-Barr virus (which causes infectious mononucleosis) and the varicella-zoster virus (which causes chickenpox). Viruses you can get if you are bitten by an infected tick, such as tick-borne encephalitis (TBE virus) and Powassan virus. Viruses you can get if you are bitten by an infected mosquito, such as eastern equine encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and La Crosse virus. Enteroviruses, which are a common group of viruses that mostly cause mild illness or respiratory infection. These infections usually happen in the summer and fall.   Bacteria, fungi, and parasites can also cause infectious encephalitis. But this is not common.  Autoimmune encephalitis happens when your immune system mistakenly attacks healthy brain cells. It can be triggered by conditions such as certain cancers, benign tumors, and infections. Sometimes the cause is not known.  Who is more likely to get encephalitis? Anyone can get encephalitis, but you are more likely to get it if you:  Have a weakened immune system, for example from having HIV or taking certain medicines. These could include medicines taken after an organ transplant, certain chemotherapy medicines, and specialized treatments for certain autoimmune diseases. Are a young child or older adult. Live in areas where there are ticks and mosquitoes that carry viruses that can cause encephalitis.   What are the symptoms of encephalitis? The symptoms of encephalitis can vary a lot, depending on how severe it is. Many people do not have any symptoms. Others may have mild flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, headache, or body aches. If encephalitis becomes more serious, it can cause:  Severe headache Stiff neck Vomiting Seizures Behavior changes Drowsiness Muscle weakness Partial paralysis in your arms and legs Coma   Encephalitis can be dangerous in infants. Their symptoms may include:  Fever Lethargy (weakness or drowsiness) Poor feeding Vomiting Body stiffness Unusual irritability or crying A full or bulging fontanel (the soft spot on the top of the head)   If you or your child is having symptoms of encephalitis, it's important to get medical care right away.  How is encephalitis diagnosed? To find out if you have encephalitis, your health care provider:  Will do a physical exam  Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms May do a neurologic exam  May order imaging tests, such as a brain CT scan or MRI May order an EEG (electroencephalography), which use small electric sensors to measure your brain activity May order blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tests   What are the treatments for encephalitis? Most people with encephalitis will need treatment in the hospital. Depending on the cause, treatments may include antiviral medicines, antibiotics, corticosteroids, and other medicines.  For some types of encephalitis, there is no medicine to treat it. But rest, nutrition, and fluids can help your body fight the infection and relieve symptoms.   Some people may need physical, speech, and occupational therapy once the illness is under control.  Can encephalitis be prevented? There are steps you can take to help prevent encephalitis that is caused by infections:  Use good hygiene, including washing your hands often with soap and water. Don't share food, drinks, utensils, and glasses with other people. Get vaccines for viruses that can cause encephalitis. Avoid mosquito and tick bites, for example by:      Wearing insect repellent with DEET or another U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent. Make sure to follow the instructions for using the repellant.   Wearing clothes that cover your arms, legs and feet.

    "disease": "Endocarditis",
    "summary": "What is endocarditis? Endocarditis is sometimes called infective endocarditis. It's a rare but life-threatening inflammation of the lining inside your heart's chambers and valves (the endocardium).  Endocarditis is usually caused by germs that get into your bloodstream and travel to your heart. Once they get inside your heart, the germs can attach to the lining or get trapped in the valves. They start to grow, causing an infection. If not treated quickly, the infection can cause damage to the heart and lead to serious health problems.  What causes endocarditis? Bacterial infections cause most endocarditis. Normally, many bacteria live in your mouth, on your skin, or in other parts of the body. Sometimes the bacteria can get into your bloodstream from injuries such cuts or scrapes. Dental work and certain surgeries can also allow small amounts of bacteria to enter your bloodstream.  In some cases, fungal infections cause endocarditis. The fungi, such as yeast, can live in parts of your body. Fungal infections generally happen in people who have weakened immune systems that can't stop the fungus from growing. This includes people who have HIV.   Who is more likely to develop endocarditis? In general, endocarditis is rare. If you're healthy, your immune system usually destroys the germs in your bloodstream before they can cause harm.  But your chance of developing endocarditis may be higher than most people if you:  Have certain heart conditions. Damaged or abnormal heart tissue and devices in your heart can trap germs more easily than healthy heart tissue. That means your risk of endocarditis is higher if you have: \t \t\tHeart valve disease. \t\tCertain congenital heart defects. \t\tA pacemaker or an implantable defibrillator. \t\tA heart valve replacement. \t  Are older. Age-related changes to the heart valves, such as mitral valve prolapse or calcium deposits in the aortic valve, create places for germs to attach to the heart.   Inject illegal drugs. Unclean needles may carry bacteria into the bloodstream.  Have a condition that weakens your immune system. Don't take care of your teeth and gums. Poor dental health makes it easier for germs to get into your bloodstream through your gums and mouth.  Have a long-term central venous line, a tube that stays in a large vein for weeks or months for medical treatment. Have already had endocarditis. Endocarditis can damage heart tissue, which increases your risk of getting it again.    What are the symptoms of endocarditis? Endocarditis symptoms may be severe or very mild. They may start suddenly or slowly. And they can vary from person to person. The possible symptoms of endocarditis include:  Fever and chills New or worsening heart murmur (an unusual sound heard between heartbeats) Chest pain Cough Muscle, joint, and back pain Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep) Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air) Skin changes, including: \t \t\tBroken blood vessels \t\tPainful red or purple bumps \t\tPainless flat red spots on the palms of your hands or soles of your feet \t    What other problems can endocarditis cause? When the germs are in your heart, they can clump together with blood cells. These clumps can break off and travel through your bloodstream. They may block blood flow, spread infection, or damage your organs, including your brain, lungs, kidneys, and spleen.  Endocarditis may sometimes lead to sepsis, a medical emergency that happens when your body has an extreme response to the infection. Endocarditis can also cause serious heart problems including:  Heart valve damage Heart failure Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat)   How is endocarditis diagnosed? To find out if you have endocarditis, your health care provider will:   Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms, recent illnesses, and other health conditions that affect your chance of developing endocarditis. Do a physical exam. Likely order tests, such as: \t \t\tBlood tests to check for signs of infection,  bacteria, or fungi in your blood. \t\tChest x-rays. \t\tHeart tests. \t \t   What are the treatments for endocarditis? If you have endocarditis, it's important to get treatment quickly. Treatments may include:  Medicines: \t \t\tAntibiotics to treat bacterial infections. Antibiotics are usually started through an intravenous (IV) line in the hospital. \t\tAntifungal medicine to treat fungal infections. Your provider may suggest taking antifungal medicine for the rest of your life to prevent the infection from coming back. \t  Heart surgery may be needed to repair or replace damaged valves and heart tissue. Surgery may also be done to remove infected tissue.  Dental care, especially cleanings, can help reduce the amount of bacteria that grows in your mouth.  Treatment may last weeks, and you may need tests to make sure it's working. Your provider will also check you for problems that could develop from endocarditis, such as heart failure or an irregular heartbeat.  Can endocarditis be prevented? If you have a higher chance of developing endocarditis than most people, you can reduce your risk if you:  Take good care of your teeth and gums every day  Have dental exams and cleaning at your dentist's office every 6 months  Make heart-healthy habits part of your daily life to help prevent heart disease  Call your health care provider right away if you have symptoms that could be endocarditis   People with the highest risk for bacterial endocarditis need antibiotics before dental visits or certain medical or surgical procedures. Ask your provider if you're part of the highest risk group. If so, let all your providers know about your risk.  NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

What causes endometriosis? Researchers don't know what causes endometriosis.  Who is at risk for endometriosis? Endometriosis can affect anyone who menstruates. Certain factors can raise or lower your risk of getting it.  You are at higher risk if:   You have a mother, sister, or daughter with endometriosis Your period started before age 11 Your monthly cycles are short (less than 27 days) Your menstrual cycles are heavy and last more than 7 days   You have a lower risk if:  You have been pregnant before Your periods started late in adolescence You breastfeed your babies    What are the symptoms of endometriosis? The main symptoms of endometriosis are:   Pelvic pain, which often happens during your period Infertility   Other possible symptoms include:  Painful menstrual cramps, which may get worse over time Pain during or after sex Pain in the intestine or lower abdomen Pain with bowel movements (pooping) or urination (peeing), usually during your period Heavy periods Spotting or bleeding between periods Digestive or gastrointestinal symptoms Fatigue or lack of energy   How is endometriosis diagnosed? Surgery is the only way to know for sure that you have endometriosis. First, however, your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and medical history. You will have a pelvic exam and may have some imaging tests. The most common surgery to diagnose endometriosis is a laparoscopy. This is a type of surgery that uses a laparoscope, a thin tube with a camera and light. The surgeon inserts the laparoscope through a small cut in the skin near your belly button. Your provider can make a diagnosis based on how the patches of endometriosis look. They may also do a biopsy to get a tissue sample.  What are the treatments for endometriosis? There is no cure for endometriosis, but there are treatments for the symptoms. Your provider will work with you to decide which treatments would be best for you.  Treatments for endometriosis pain include:  Pain relievers, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and a prescription medicine specifically for endometriosis. Providers may sometimes prescribe opioids for severe pain. Hormone therapy, which stops the ovaries from making hormones. This may slow the growth of the endometrial tissue and may stop new areas from growing. Types of hormone therapy include:  \t \t\tBirth control pills. \t\tProgestin therapy. \t\tGonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) medicines (GnRH agonists and antagonists).  These medicines cause a temporary menopause.

    "summary": "What is the prostate? The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder. It makes fluid that is part of semen.   What is an enlarged prostate (BPH)? An enlarged prostate is when your prostate gland becomes larger than normal. It's also called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH for short. Benign means not cancer. And hyperplasia means too much cell growth. BPH isn't cancer and it doesn't increase your risk of getting prostate cancer. Usually, the prostate gland continues to grow during adult life. That's why BPH is the most common prostate condition in people over age 50. As the prostate gets bigger, it may press against the bladder and pinch the urethra. This can slow or block the flow of urine out of your bladder. Over time, the bladder muscle may become weak from trying to pass urine through a narrow urethra.  When this happens, your bladder may not empty completely when you urinate. A narrowed urethra and weak bladder cause many of the urinary problems you may have with BPH.  What causes an enlarged prostate (BPH)? Researchers aren't sure why the prostate keeps growing. Some researchers think changes in hormones with aging may cause the prostate to get bigger.  Who is more likely to develop BPH? You're more likely to develop BPH if you:  Are age 40 or older. The chance of getting BPH increases as you get older. Have family members who have had BPH. Have certain health conditions such as: \t \t\tObesity. \t\tHeart disease and problems with blood circulation. \t\tType 2 diabetes. \t\tErectile dysfunction. \t  Don't get enough physical activity.   What are the symptoms of BPH? Symptoms of BPH include:  Having a frequent or urgent need to urinate  Waking up many times to urinate Having problems with urine flow, such as: \t \t\tTrouble starting to urinate \t\tA stream that's weak, slow, or stops and starts \t\tDribbling after urination \t\tUrinary incontinence \t\tFeeling that you can't completely empty your bladder \t  Pain after ejaculation or during urination Urine with an unusual color or smell   It's important to see your health care provider if you have any of these symptoms because they could be from a more serious health problem.  You should get medical help right away if you:  Can't urinate at all Have fever and chills with urination that's painful, frequent, and urgent Have blood in your urine Have pain in your lower abdomen (belly) and urinary tract   What other problems can BPH cause? For most people, BPH doesn't cause other problems. But BPH increases your chance of developing serious conditions, including:   Acute urinary retention. With this condition, you suddenly can't urinate at all. This a medical emergency.  Acute urinary retention is common in older males and the chance of having it increases with age. It may be triggered by: \t \t\tTaking certain over-the-counter cold or allergy medicines \t\tDrinking alcohol \t\tCold temperatures \t\tNot moving enough over a long period of time \t  Urinary tract infections (UTIs) Bladder damage and bladder stones Kidney damage   How is BPH diagnosed? To find out if you have BPH, your provider will:  Ask about your medical history. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take, because certain medicines can make BPH symptoms worse. Ask about your family health history.  Examine you. The exam may include a digital rectal exam (DRE) of your prostate. In a DRE, your provider inserts a gloved finger into your rectum to check if your prostate is large, tender, or irregular in any other way.  Order medical tests, if needed, such as: \t\t \t\t\tUrine tests.  \t\t\tA PSA blood test (prostate-specific antigen test). \t\t\tUrodynamic testing to see how well you can hold and release urine. \t\t\tCystoscopy to look inside your urethra and bladder. \t\t\tUltrasound pictures of your prostate and urinary tract. \t\t\tA prostate biopsy to diagnose or rule out prostate cancer.  \t\t    What are the treatments for BPH? Not everyone needs treatment for BPH. Treatment options depend on how much your symptoms bother you, your health, age, and the size of your prostate:  Lifestyle changes may improve mild symptoms. They include: \t \t\tDrinking less before bedtime or going out \t\tAvoiding or cutting back on beverages with caffeine and alcohol \t\tBladder training and exercising the muscles that control urine flow \t\tPreventing or treating constipation \t   Medicines can help mild to moderate symptoms by: \t \t\tStopping the prostate from growing \t\tShrinking the prostate \t\tRelaxing muscles to improve urine flow \t  \tSometimes combining 2 types of medicine helps more than taking just one type of medicine.   Medical procedures can help improve moderate to severe BPH symptoms when medicines don't help enough. There are several different types of procedures. They all use an instrument inserted into the urethra to either: \t \t\tWiden the urethra \t\tDestroy part of the prostate with heat \t   Surgery may be helpful when symptoms are severe, other treatments haven't helped, or you have another problem, such as bladder damage. Different types of surgery are used to: \t\t\t \t\tRemove part or all of the prostate \t\tMake cuts in the prostate to take pressure off the urethra \t  \tMost BPH surgery is done with tools inserted into the urethra.     Your provider can explain the possible benefits and side effects of your treatment options so you can decide what's best for you.   Can BPH be prevented? Researchers haven't found ways to prevent BPH.

In infants and toddlers:: Feeding problems Vomiting Poor weight gain and growth Reflux that does not get better with medicines   In older children:: Vomiting Abdominal pain Trouble swallowing, especially with solid foods Reflux that does not get better with medicines Poor appetite   In adults:: Trouble swallowing, especially with solid foods Food getting stuck in the esophagus Reflux that does not get better with medicines Heartburn Chest pain   How is eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) diagnosed? To find out if you have EoE, your doctor will likely: Ask about your symptoms and medical history. Since other conditions can have the same symptoms of EoE, it is important for your doctor to take a thorough history. Do an upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. An endoscope is a long, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end of it. Your doctor will run the endoscope down your esophagus and look at it. Some signs that you might have EoE include white spots, rings, narrowing, and inflammation in the esophagus. However, not everyone with EoE has those signs, and sometimes they can be signs of a different esophagus disorder.  Do a biopsy. During the endoscopy, the doctor will take small tissue samples from your esophagus. The samples will be checked for a high number of eosinophils. This is the only way to make a diagnosis of EoE. Do other tests as needed. You may have blood tests to check for other conditions. If you do have EoE, you may have blood or other types of tests to check for specific allergies.    What are the treatments for eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)? There is no cure for EoE. Treatments can manage your symptoms and prevent further damage. The two main types of treatments are medicines and diet.  Medicines used to treat EoE are: Steroids, which can help control inflammation. These are usually topical steroids, which you swallow either from an inhaler or as a liquid. Sometimes doctors prescribe oral steroids (pills) to treat people who have serious swallowing problems or weight loss. Acid suppressors such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), which may help with reflux symptoms and decrease inflammation. Monoclonal antibodies, which can reduce inflammation and may help with swallowing. They can be used in adults and children over age 12.   Dietary changes for EoE include: Elimination diet. If you are on an elimination diet, you stop eating and drinking certain foods and beverages for several weeks. If you are feeling better, you add the foods back to your diet one at a time. You have repeat endoscopies to see whether or not you are tolerating those foods. There are different types of elimination diets:    With one type, you first have an allergy test. Then you stop eating and drinking the foods you are allergic to.   For another type, you eliminate foods and drinks that commonly cause allergies, such as dairy products, egg, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts and fish/shellfish.   Elemental diet. With this diet, you stop eating and drinking all proteins. Instead, you drink an amino acid formula. Some people who do not like the taste of the formula use a feeding tube instead. If your symptoms and inflammation go away completely, you may be able to try adding foods back one at a time, to see whether you can tolerate them.   Which treatment your doctor suggests depends on different factors, including your age. Some people may use more than one kind of treatment. Researchers are still trying to understand EoE and how best to treat it.  If your treatment is not working well enough and you have narrowing of the esophagus, you may need dilation. This is a procedure to stretch the esophagus. This makes it easier for you to swallow.",

    "summary": "What are esophagus disorders? Esophagus disorders are problems with how your esophagus works. The esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. You usually don't notice it unless you swallow something too big, hot, or cold. You might also notice it if something is wrong. When that happens, you might feel pain or have trouble swallowing (dysphagia).  What causes esophagus disorders? The cause depends on the type of disorder. Some run in families. Others are linked to allergic reactions to food or substances in your environment. Sometimes, the cause is unknown.    You may be more likely to develop an esophagus disorder if you:   Are overweight or have obesity Are pregnant  Take certain medicines Have had radiation treatmentt to your neck or chest Smoke or are around secondhand smoke   What are common esophagus disorders? The most common esophagus problem is gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This happens when the muscle at the bottom of your esophagus doesn't close properly. Stomach acid can move back up and irritate the esophagus.   Other esophagus disorders include:  Heartburn is a burning feeling in your chest or throat. It is often caused by acid reflux.   Barrett's Esophagus happens when the lining of your esophagus changes. It is often caused by chronic (long-term) GERD. Achalasia is a problem where the lower muscle in your esophagus doesn't relax like it should.  Esophageal Spasms are muscle contractions that cause chest pain or swallowing problems. Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a rare condition where certain white blood cells (eosinophils) build up in the esophagus, causing swelling, pain, and trouble swallowing.   Esophageal Cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the tissues of the esophagus.   What are symptoms of esophagus disorders? Symptoms can be different for each condition but may include:   Pain in your chest, abdomen (belly), or back  A cough or sore throat that doesn't go away  Trouble swallowing or feeling like food is stuck   A hoarse voice or wheezing  Heartburn or a burning feeling in your stomach  Tasting acid or food in the back of your mouth  Food or liquid coming back up into your mouth (regurgitation)  Losing weight without trying     Get medical help right away if you have chest pain with shortness of breath, or pain in your jaw or arm. These could be signs of a heart problem.   How are esophagus disorders diagnosed? Your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and medical history. They may order one or more tests, such as:   Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy. This test uses a tiny camera to look inside your esophagus and stomach.   Biopsy. This test takes a small tissue sample to check.  Barium swallow. This test uses imaging to see how you swallow.   Esophageal manometry. This test checks how well your esophagus moves food to your stomach.   Esophageal pH test. This test measures how often acid backs up into your esophagus and how long the acid stays there.     How are esophagus disorders treated? Treatment depends on what's causing the problem and your overall health. Some esophagus disorders get better with over-the-counter medicines, diet changes, or lifestyle changes. Others may need prescription medicine or surgery.   Without treatment, some disorders may lead to other problems, such as pneumonia, from food entering the windpipe. GERD, Barrett's esophagus, and achalasia can also raise your risk for esophageal cancer.   Can esophagus disorders be prevented? You can help prevent or reduce symptoms by:   Not smoking and limiting alcohol Eating smaller meals Avoiding eating close to bedtime Wearing loose-fitting clothes Sleeping on your left side or raising the head of your bed Maintaining a healthy weight   NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

    "disease": "Evaluating Health Information",
    "summary": "Why do I need to evaluate health information? Health information is easy to find. But finding reliable health information takes a little effort. Some of the health information you get from newspapers, magazines, books, TV, the Internet, and social media is up to date and trustworthy. But some is not. That's why it's important to evaluate health information for yourself.  But how can you tell the good from the bad? There are two key steps:  Ask questions before you trust what you read or hear.  Discuss the information you find with your health care provider before you rely on it. You may have found good information, but your provider can tell you whether it's good for you.     How can I evaluate health information on the Internet? Asking a few questions will help you decide if you can trust a website. You can usually find most of the answers on the site's \"About Us\" page.  If you can't find information about who runs the website, the site may not be trustworthy, and their health information may be unreliable. Some questions to ask are:  Who runs the site? Can you trust them to provide balanced, accurate information? Trustworthy sites provide a way to contact the owners with questions or feedback.  In general, you'll find good health information on websites run by:    Federal government agencies.   Medical schools.   Large professional or nonprofit organizations. For example, the American College of Cardiology (a professional organization) and the American Heart Association (a nonprofit) and are both reliable sources of information on heart health.      What's the purpose of the site? Is it to:    Inform the public?    Sell products or services?   Promote the opinions of a person or group?   A trustworthy website has one goal: To give you good information.    Who pays for the site?      If the site is funded by ads, they should be clearly marked as advertisements.  Watch out for ads designed to look like neutral health information.    If a business pays for the site, the health information may favor that business and its products.       Is the health information high quality? Good health information doesn't promote one treatment over another. It gives you balanced facts based on research. So, beware of dramatic writing, promises of cures, and claims that sound too good to be true. Those could be signs of a health fraud scam. To evaluate the quality of a website's information, ask:      How is the information selected and reviewed to make sure it's accurate?  Check the \"About Us\" page to see if the site has:       An editorial board of health experts   A content review process   A selection policy for content   Information about their writers' qualifications, which may be listed at the bottom of the articles        Where does the information come from? The content pages should have links or references to the sources of the information.   Is the information up to date? Content pages should include dates when the information was written, reviewed, or updated.       How does the website use your personal information? Look for a privacy policy section to see how your personal information will be used. Don't share information about yourself unless you're comfortable with any risks involved.    When you find a website that seems to be trustworthy, don't stop there. Look to see if other reliable sites have similar health information.  How can I evaluate health information on social media? A social media post may come from someone you know, but that doesn't guarantee it's good information. Many of the questions you use to evaluate a website also work for social media too. Ask where the information comes from, why it exists, and if anyone is funding it.  If you're not sure whether the information you see on social media is trustworthy, don\"t share it with others.  How can I evaluate health stories in the news? Some news stories about medical research may not include all the facts you need to know.  Ask these questions:  Does the story say whether the research involved people or animals?  If it was people, how many people were in the study and who were they?  How long was the study? What type of study was it?  Who paid for the research?   If you learn a few tips for understanding medical research, you'll be able to decide if a news story may apply to your health. Then you can discuss the information with your provider.   How can I evaluate health information in books? To evaluate health information in books, ask:  How old is the book?  Is the author an expert on the subject? Does the book offer different points of view or just those of the author? Has the book been reviewed by other experts? Does the book list the sources of the content?    After you evaluate health information, talk with your provider before using it to make decisions that may affect your health.

    "summary": "What are the basics of exercise and physical fitness?  Exercise is anything that gets your body moving. Regular exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health. It has many benefits, including improving your overall health and fitness, and reducing your risk for many chronic (long-term) diseases.   Every physical fitness routine is built on a few simple ideas. These include:   Make exercise a habit, as your body adapts to the type of activity you do most often. Regular practice will help you improve.  Build up your activity level slowly to help you continue to get stronger, faster, or more flexible without pushing too hard all at once. Challenge yourself by lifting slightly heavier weights, adding a few more minutes to your walk, or increasing your pace. Mix up your workouts to keep things interesting and help prevent injuries or burnout.  Show up regularly, even for short sessions, to help you continue to make progress.    What are the different types of exercise? There are many different types of exercise. Before you start, check with your health care provider, especially if you have trouble moving, balancing, or worry that exercise might not be safe for you.   A few main types of exercise include:   Aerobic exercises such as walking, running, or swimming are sometimes referred to as cardio. This is short for cardiovascular exercise. These exercises increase your breathing and heart rate. They keep your heart, lungs, and circulatory system healthy and improve your overall fitness.  Strength, or resistance training, exercises use weights, resistance bands, or your own body weight to build stronger muscles.  Balance exercises, such as tai chi or standing on one leg, improve your stability and coordination. They may make it easier for you to walk on uneven surfaces and help prevent falls.  Flexibility exercises, such as stretching or yoga, help your joints move more easily and improve your posture.   Most people benefit from a combination of these types of exercises. Your provider can help you choose the best type or amount of activity for you based on your fitness level and health.  How can I fit exercise into my day?  Fitting regular exercise into your daily schedule may seem difficult at first. But you can start slowly and break your exercise time into chunks. Even small amounts of exercise can be helpful. You can work your way up to doing the recommended amount of exercise.&nbsp;How much exercise you need&nbsp;depends on your age and health.   To get started, you don't need fancy equipment, but having the right tools can make it easier and more fun. There are a variety of places where you can exercise and create a routine that fits your lifestyle. This includes:   At home. Dumbbells, kettlebells, a mat, or resistance bands are versatile and affordable options for strength training and stretching. A treadmill, a stationary bike, or a workout video are a few options for indoor cardio.  A fitness center, gym, or health club. These places offer equipment, classes, and sometimes personal trainers for guidance and support. Ask if you can try the center before you join, and if staff are available to show you how to use the exercise equipment. Outdoors. Try riding a bike, walking your dog, or exploring local parks and trails. Dress for the weather and protect yourself from the sun. If safety is a concern, choose a well-lit neighborhood, a busy park, or even an indoor shopping mall for your walk.   Include activities that strengthen all parts of your body, especially your core, which are the muscles in your abdomen (belly), back, and hips. A strong core helps with balance&nbsp;and stability and can lower your risk of&nbsp;back injuries.  If you&nbsp;haven't exercised in a while, start slowly and talk to your provider if you have health concerns. If you don't feel right, or have any pain, extreme&nbsp;shortness of breath, or&nbsp;dizziness, stop exercising and seek help right away.  How can I stay motivated? Even with the best intentions, it's easy to fall off track. Here are some ways to keep going:    Choose activities you enjoy. It's easier to make exercise a regular part of your life if you have fun doing it. Exercise safely. Use the proper equipment to prevent&nbsp;injuries, listen to your body, and don't overdo it.  Give yourself goals. Your goals should be challenging, but realistic. It may be helpful to reward yourself when you reach them. The rewards could be something big, like new workout gear, or something smaller, such as a new water bottle or movie tickets.  Mix it up. Try a new class, playlist, Podcast, or outdoor route when things get stale. Find an accountability partner. Exercise with a friend, join a group challenge, or check in with an online community. Use wearable technology. A pedometer or an app like a fitness tracker on your phone or other device can help you track your progress.",

    "summary": "Why does eye care matter? Eye care is about keeping your eyes healthy through good daily habits, regular checkups, and treatment when needed. Your eyes are an important part of your health. You rely on them every day to see and understand the world around you. Some eye diseases can lead to vision loss without early warning signs, so it's important to catch them as soon as possible. Get your eyes checked as often as your health care provider recommends, or if you notice new vision problems. Just like caring for the rest of your body, it's important to keep your eyes healthy.   How can I keep my eyes healthy?  There are many things you can do to protect your eyes and see your best:  Give your eyes a rest. Spending long hours on a computer or other digital screens can make you blink less, causing dryness and tired eyes. To reduce eyestrain, try the 20-20-20 rule: Every 20 minutes, look away about 20 feet in front of you for 20 seconds.  Wear sunglasses. Sun exposure can damage your eyes and raise your risk of cataracts and age-related macular degeneration. Protect your eyes by using sunglasses that block out 99 to 100% of both UV-A and UV-B radiation.  Wear protective eyewear. To prevent eye injuries, you need eye protection when playing certain sports, working in jobs such as factory work and construction, and doing repairs or projects in your home. Avoid rubbing your eyes. Rubbing your eyes can transfer dirt and bacteria that may cause irritation or lead to an infection.  Use good lighting. Brighten your space to reduce strain and help you see comfortably.  If you wear contacts, take steps to prevent eye infections. Wash your hands before you put in or take out your contact lenses. Also follow the instructions on how to properly clean them and replace them when needed.   How can my nutrition and lifestyle habits affect my eye health? What you eat and how you take care of your body can have a big impact on your eyes and vision:  Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Your diet should include plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially dark leafy green vegetables like spinach, kale, or collard greens. Eating fish high in omega-3 fatty acids, such as salmon, tuna, and halibut can also help your eyes. Maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk of developing diabetes. Having diabetes puts you at higher risk of getting diabetic retinopathy or glaucoma. Get regular exercise. Exercise may help to prevent or control diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. These diseases can lead to some eye or vision problems. Regular exercise helps lower your risk.  Avoid smoking. Smoking increases the risk of developing age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration and cataracts and can damage the optic nerve. Know your family medical history. Some eye diseases are inherited (passed down through families), so it is important to find out whether anyone in your family has had them. This can help you determine if you are at higher risk of developing an eye disease. Know your other risk factors. As you get older, you are at higher risk of developing age-related eye diseases and conditions. It is important to know your risk factors because you may be able to lower your risk by changing some behaviors.   What's the difference between an eye test and an eye exam? Everyone needs their eyesight tested to check for vision and eye problems. Children usually have vision screening, also called an eye test, in school or at their provider's office during a checkup. This is a brief test that mainly checks how well you can see things up close and far away. Adults may also get vision screenings during their checkups. But many adults need more than a vision screening. They need a comprehensive dilated eye exam.  Getting comprehensive dilated eye exams is especially important because some eye diseases may not have warning signs. The exams are the only way to detect these diseases in their early stages, when they are easier to treat.  The eye exam includes several tests:  Test your side (peripheral) vision with a visual field test. Losing peripheral vision may be a sign of glaucoma. Check how well you see at various distances with a visual acuity test, where you read an eye chart about 20 feet away. Follow an object with your eyes during an eye muscle function test to check for problems with the muscles that control your eyes. Shine a light into your eyes with a pupil response test to see how your pupils react to light. Measure the pressure inside your eyes with tonometry. This test helps to detect glaucoma. Dilate (widen) your pupils with special eye drops allows more light to enter the eye. Your eye care provider then uses a special magnifying lens to clearly see important tissues at the back of your eye, including the retina, macula, and optic nerve.   If you have a refractive error and are going to need glasses or contacts, then you will also have a refraction test. When you have this test, you look through a device that has lenses of different strengths to help your eye care professional figure out which lenses will give you the clearest vision.  When should I start getting eye exams? How often you need eye exams depends on your age, race, risk factors, and overall health.  For example, Black/African American adults are at higher risk for glaucoma and may need to start exams earlier. If you have diabetes, you should have an exam every year. Check with your provider about when you need these exams. See an eye care specialist right away if you have symptoms like sudden loss of vision, double vision, blurred vision with eye pain, flashes of light, black spots or halos around lights. These symptoms may represent a serious medical or eye condition.",

Refractive errors are the most common type of vision problem that makes it hard to see clearly. But some eye conditions or diseases don't have any symptoms and can lead to a permanent loss of vision.   Some common eye diseases and conditions include:  Cataracts, which happens when the clear lens in the front of your eye becomes cloudy. Cataracts are common as you get older and can lead to vision loss. Optic nerve disorders, which includes glaucoma. Glaucoma usually happens when the fluid pressure inside your eyes slowly rises. Retinal disorders, which are problems with the nerve layer at the back of your eye. Macular degeneration, which is a disease that destroys your sharp, central vision. Diabetic eye problems, which can cause vision loss and blindness. Conjunctivitis, which is an infection also known as pink eye. It can cause pink or red itchy eyes.

Treatment may depend on the eye condition or disease but can include:  A new prescription for eyeglasses or contacts Use of bright lights or magnifying lenses for reading and other activities Medicines  Prescription eye drops or ointments Laser treatment Surgery   Depending on your eye condition or disease, treatment may slow vision loss but may not restore vision. Talk to your provider about what treatment is best for you.  Can eye diseases be prevented? Your best defense is to have regular checkups. Be sure to tell your provider if any eye diseases run in your family.   You can also help take care of your vision by making lifestyle changes to lower your risk of health conditions that can cause vision problems.

When you blink, they spread tears across your eyes and help wash away dirt or dust. You also close your eyelids when something comes near your eyes to protect them from injury.   Like other parts of your body, your eyelids can get infected, become swollen, or develop growths or eye cancer.   What causes eyelid disorders? The cause depends on the type of disorder. Some eyelid disorders may run in families, while others happen for unknown reasons.   What are common eyelid disorders? There are many kinds of eyelid problems. They can cause swelling, infection, irritation, or change how your eyelids look or move. Some may cause lumps or growths on or around the eyelids.  Eyelid disorders that cause swelling, redness, or infection include:  Stye (hordeolum). A small, red, painful bump caused by a bacterial infection in an oil gland. A chalazion is a painless lump that may form after a stye. Blepharitis. Makes your eyelids red, itchy, or burning and can cause crusty eyelashes. It's often linked to bacteria or skin conditions like rosacea. Periorbital cellulitis. A bacterial infection of the eyelid and nearby skin. If it spreads behind the eye (orbital cellulitis), it needs immediate medical care.   Eyelid disorders that affect eyelid position or movement include:  Ectropion (eyelids turn out). The inner eyelid is exposed, which can cause irritation or tearing. Entropion (eyelids turn in). The eyelashes rub against the eye, causing discomfort or damage. Ptosis (drooping eyelid). Often caused by weak muscles, aging, or nerve damage.   Eyelid growths include:   Xanthelasma. Yellowish patches of cholesterol near the inner corners of the eyelids. Papilloma. A benign (noncancerous), wart-like skin growth. Basal cell carcinoma. The most common eyelid cancer, often on the lower eyelid. Squamous cell carcinoma. A less common but faster-growing skin cancer. Sebaceous gland carcinoma. A rare but serious cancer of the eyelid's oil glands.   Eyelid disorders that affect blinking or eyelid movement include:  Blepharospasm. Eyelid blinking or twitching you can't control.  Myokymia. A minor, occasional eyelid twitch often caused by fatigue or stress.   What are the symptoms of eyelid disorders? Symptoms can vary depending on the condition but may include:  Feeling like something is in your eye Burning or stinging  Watery or itchy eyes  Red, swollen eyelids Blurry vision   How are eyelid disorders diagnosed? Your eye care specialist may diagnose eyelid disorders during an eye exam. They may also ask about your medical and family history to help find the cause.  How are eyelid disorders treated? Treatment depends on the cause of the disorder. Some eyelid conditions get better on their own or may be related to another health condition. Keeping your eyelids clean can help prevent irritation and infection.   If you need treatment, it may include:  Warm compresses Medicines or ointments Eye drops Surgery (less common)  Lifestyle changes, such as getting more sleep or cutting back on caffeine",

Fatigue can be a normal response to physical activity, emotional stress, boredom, or lack of sleep. But sometimes it can be a sign of a mental or physical condition. If you have been feeling tired for weeks, contact your health care provider. They can help you find out what's causing your fatigue and recommend ways to relieve it.  What causes fatigue? Fatigue itself is not a disease; it's a symptom. It can have many different causes, including pregnancy and various medical problems, treatments, and lifestyle habits such as:  Medical problems: \t \t\tChronic (long-lasting) diseases such as diabetes, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and heart, liver, kidney and thyroid diseases \t\tUntreated pain and diseases like fibromyalgia \t\tAnemia \t\tInfections \t\tParkinson's disease \t\tSleep apnea and other sleep disorders \t\tRecent stroke \t\tMental disorders such as depression and anxiety \t  Treatments: \t \t\tCancer treatments such as chemotherapy, radiation, and bone marrow transplants \t\tRecovering from major surgery \t\tTaking certain medicines, such as antidepressants, antihistamines, and medicines for nausea and pain \t  Lifestyle habits: \t \t\tNot getting enough sleep \t\tStaying up too late \t\tDrinking too much alcohol \t\tSubstance use \t\tHaving too much caffeine (which can keep you from getting a good night's sleep) \t\tGetting too little or too much exercise \t    Overwhelming fatigue is part of a disorder called myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS).

If you've had fatigue that does not get better after several weeks, call your provider. They will ask questions about your sleep, daily activities, appetite, and exercise. They will likely do a physical exam and order lab tests. Once they decide on a diagnosis, they can tell you what treatments might help.  You can also make some lifestyle changes to feel less tired:  Get regular physical activity Improve your sleep habits Stop smoking (if you smoke), since smoking is linked to many diseases that can cause fatigue Manage stress Eat a healthy diet and avoid alcohol    It also may be helpful for you to keep a fatigue diary.

    "disease": "Fatty Liver Disease",
    "summary": "What is fatty liver disease? Your liver is the largest organ inside your body. It helps your body digest food, store energy, and remove poisons. Fatty liver disease is a condition in which fat builds up in your liver. There are two main types: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) Alcoholic fatty liver disease, also called alcoholic steatohepatitis   What is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)? NAFLD is a type of fatty liver disease that is not related to heavy alcohol use. There are two kinds: Simple fatty liver, in which you have fat in your liver but little or no inflammation or liver cell damage. Simple fatty liver typically does not get bad enough to cause liver damage or complications. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), in which you have inflammation and liver cell damage, as well as fat in your liver. Inflammation and liver cell damage can cause fibrosis, or scarring, of the liver. NASH may lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer.   What is alcoholic fatty liver disease? Alcoholic fatty liver disease is due to heavy alcohol use. Your liver breaks down most of the alcohol you drink, so it can be removed from your body. But the process of breaking it down can generate harmful substances. These substances can damage liver cells, promote inflammation, and weaken your body's natural defenses. The more alcohol that you drink, the more you damage your liver.  Alcoholic fatty liver disease is the earliest stage of alcohol-related liver disease. The next stages are alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis.  Who is at risk for fatty liver disease? The cause of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is unknown. Researchers do know that it is more common in people who: Have type 2 diabetes and prediabetes Have obesity Are middle aged or older (although children can also get it) Are Hispanic, followed by non-Hispanic Whites. It is less common in African Americans. Have high levels of fats in the blood, such as cholesterol and triglycerides Have high blood pressure Take certain drugs, such as corticosteroids and some cancer drugs Have certain metabolic disorders, including metabolic syndrome Have rapid weight loss Have certain infections, such as hepatitis C Have been exposed to some toxins   NAFLD affects about 25% of people in the world. As the rates of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and high cholesterol are rising in the United States, so is the rate of NAFLD. NAFLD is the most common chronic liver disorder in the United States.   Alcoholic fatty liver disease only happens in people who are heavy drinkers, especially those who have been drinking for a long period of time. The risk is higher for heavy drinkers who are women, have obesity, or have certain genetic mutations.  What are the symptoms of fatty liver disease? Both NAFLD and alcoholic fatty liver disease are usually silent diseases with few or no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, you may feel tired or have discomfort in the upper right side of your abdomen.  How is fatty liver disease diagnosed? Because there are often no symptoms, it is not easy to find fatty liver disease. Your doctor may suspect that you have it if you get abnormal results on liver tests that you had for other reasons. To make a diagnosis, your doctor will use: Your medical history A physical exam Various tests, including blood and imaging tests, and sometimes a biopsy   As part of the medical history, your doctor will ask about your alcohol use, to find out whether fat in your liver is a sign of alcoholic fatty liver disease or nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD). He or she will also ask which medicines you take, to try to determine whether a medicine is causing your NAFLD.  During the physical exam, your doctor will examine your body and check your weight and height. Your doctor will look for signs of fatty liver disease, such as: An enlarged liver Signs of cirrhosis, such as jaundice, a condition that causes your skin and whites of your eyes to turn yellow   You will likely have blood tests, including liver function tests and blood count tests. In some cases you may also have imaging tests, like those that check for fat in the liver and the stiffness of your liver. Liver stiffness can mean fibrosis, which is scarring of the liver. In some cases you may also need a liver biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, and to check how bad the liver damage is.  What are the treatments for fatty liver disease? Doctors recommend weight loss for nonalcoholic fatty liver. Weight loss can reduce fat in the liver, inflammation, and fibrosis. If your doctor thinks that a certain medicine is the cause of your NAFLD, you should stop taking that medicine.  But check with your doctor before stopping the medicine. You may need to get off the medicine gradually, and you might need to switch to another medicine instead.  There are no medicines that have been approved to treat NAFLD. Studies are investigating whether a certain diabetes medicine or Vitamin E can help, but more studies are needed.  The most important part of treating alcohol-related fatty liver disease is to stop drinking alcohol. If you need help doing that, you may want to see a therapist or participate in an alcohol recovery program. There are also medicines that can help, either by reducing your cravings or making you feel sick if you drink alcohol.  Both alcoholic fatty liver disease and one type of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis) can lead to cirrhosis. Doctors can treat the health problems caused by cirrhosis with medicines, operations, and other medical procedures. If the cirrhosis leads to liver failure, you may need a liver transplant.  What are some lifestyle changes that can help with fatty liver disease? If you have any of the types of fatty liver disease, there are some lifestyle changes that can help: Eat a healthy diet, limiting salt and sugar, plus eating lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains Get vaccinations for hepatitis A and B, the flu and pneumococcal disease. If you get hepatitis A or B along with fatty liver, it is more likely to lead to liver failure. People with chronic liver disease are more likely to get infections, so the other two vaccinations are also important. Get regular exercise, which can help you lose weight and reduce fat in the liver Talk with your doctor before using dietary supplements, such as vitamins, or any complementary or alternative medicines or medical practices. Some herbal remedies can damage your liver.",

People with fetal alcohol syndrome have facial abnormalities, including wide-set and narrow eyes, growth problems and nervous system abnormalities.  Diagnosing FASD can be hard because there is no medical test, like a blood test, for it.

There is no cure for FASDs, but treatments can help. These include medicines to help with some symptoms, medical care for health problems, behavior and education therapy, and parent training. A good treatment plan is specific to the child's problems. It should include close monitoring, follow-ups, and changes when needed.  Certain \"protective factors\" can help reduce the effects of FASDs and help people who have them reach their full potential. They include: Diagnosis before 6 years of age Loving, nurturing, and stable home environment during the school years Absence of violence around them Involvement in special education and social services   There is no known safe amount of alcohol during pregnancy.

In the United States, parvovirus B19 infections are more common in late winter, spring, and early summer. There are usually minor outbreaks of fifth disease about every 3 to 4 years.  What causes fifth disease? Parvovirus B19, which causes fifth disease, can spread from person to person:  Through respiratory droplets, such as saliva (spit), sputum, or nasal mucus. The droplets can spread when: \t \t\tSomeone who has the virus coughs and sneezes \t\tYou touch an item that has the virus on it \t  Through blood or blood products From a pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy   You are most contagious early in your infection, when you usually only have a fever or cold-like symptoms. You are not likely to be contagious after you get later symptoms such as a rash and joint pain.  What are the symptoms of fifth disease? About 2 out of 10 people who get a B19 parvovirus infection will have no symptoms.  But most people will get the symptoms of fifth disease, which are usually mild and can include:  Fever Headache Cough Sore throat Rashes Joint pain   The \"slapped cheek\" rash is more common in children. They usually get the rash a few days after they first have other symptoms. The rash can then spread to the arms, legs, chest, back, and buttocks.  Adults who get fifth disease might also have joint pain and swelling (called polyarthropathy syndrome).  Sometimes the infection can cause serious health complications affecting the nerves, joints, or blood system. This is more likely to happen if you are pregnant, have a blood disorder such as anemia, or a weakened immune system.  Because of these risks to you and some possible risks to your baby, contact your health care provider if you are pregnant and:  You show signs of fifth disease (or a \"slapped cheek\" rash) You may have been exposed to someone who has the infection   How is fifth disease diagnosed? There is no routine lab test to diagnose fifth disease. Providers can often diagnose fifth disease just by seeing the \"slapped cheek\" rash and rashes on the body.   There is testing to show whether or not you have protection (immunity) against the B19 parvovirus or if you have had a recent infection. This test is usually not needed, but your provider may order the test if you are pregnant or at higher risk for complications of the disease.  What are the treatments for fifth disease? There is no specific treatment for fifth disease. It is usually mild and goes away on its own.   To feel better, get plenty of rest. Taking acetaminophen can help with the fever and pain. Do not give aspirin to children, because it may cause Reye syndrome. This is a rare, serious illness that can affect the brain and liver.  Can fifth disease be prevented? There is no vaccine to prevent fifth disease. But you can help protect yourself and others by:  Washing your hands often with soap and water Covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze Avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands  Avoiding close contact with people who are sick Staying home when you are sick   Most people become immune to the virus after having it once.

    "disease": "Flu",
    "summary": "What is the flu? The flu, also called influenza, is a respiratory infection caused by viruses. Each year, millions of Americans get sick with the flu. Sometimes it causes mild illness. But it can also be serious or even deadly, especially for people over 65, newborn babies, and people with certain chronic illnesses.  What causes the flu? The flu is caused by flu viruses that spread from person to person. When someone with the flu coughs, sneezes, or talks, they spray tiny droplets. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby. Less often, a person may get flu by touching a surface or object that has flu virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes.  What are the symptoms of the flu? Symptoms of the flu come on suddenly and may include: Fever or feeling feverish/chills Cough Sore throat Runny or stuffy nose Muscle or body aches Headaches Fatigue (tiredness)   Some people may also have vomiting and diarrhea. This is more common in children.  Sometimes people have trouble figuring out whether they have a cold or the flu. There are differences between them:   \t \t\t \t\t\tSigns and Symptoms \t\t\tCold \t\t\tFlu \t\t \t \t \t\t \t\t\tStart of symptoms \t\t\tSlowly \t\t\tSuddenly \t\t \t\t \t\t\tFever \t\t\tRarely \t\t\tUsually \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAches \t\t\tSometimes (slight) \t\t\tUsually \t\t \t\t \t\t\tFatigue, weakness \t\t\tSometimes \t\t\tUsually \t\t \t\t \t\t\tHeadache \t\t\tRarely \t\t\tCommon \t\t \t\t \t\t\tStuffy nose, sneezing, or sore throat \t\t\tCommon \t\t\tSometimes \t\t \t    Sometimes people say that they have a \"flu\" when they really have something else. For example, \"stomach flu\" isn't the flu; it's gastroenteritis.  What other problems can the flu cause? Some people who get the flu will develop complications. Some of these complications can be serious or even life-threatening. They include: Bronchitis Ear infection Sinus infection Pneumonia Inflammation of the heart (myocarditis), brain (encephalitis), or muscle tissues (myositis, rhabdomyolysis)   The flu also can make chronic health problems worse. For example, people with asthma may have asthma attacks while they have flu.  Certain people are more likely to have complications from the flu, including: Adults 65 and older Pregnant women Children younger than 5 People with certain chronic health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease   How is the flu diagnosed? To diagnose the flu, health care providers will first do a medical history and ask about your symptoms. There are several tests for the flu. For the tests, your provider will swipe the inside of your nose or the back of your throat with a swab. Then the swab will be tested for the flu virus.  Some tests are quick and give results in 15-20 minutes. But these tests are not as accurate as other flu tests. These other tests can give you the results in one hour or several hours.  What are the treatments for the flu? Most people with the flu recover on their own without medical care. People with mild cases of the flu should stay home and avoid contact with others, except to get medical care.   But if you have symptoms of flu and are in a high risk group or are very sick or worried about your illness, contact your health care provider. You might need antiviral medicines to treat your flu. Antiviral medicines can make the illness milder and shorten the time you are sick. They also can prevent serious flu complications. They usually work best when you start taking them within 2 days of getting sick.  Can the flu be prevented?  The best way to prevent the flu is to get a flu vaccine every year. But it's also important to have good health habits like covering your cough and washing your hands often. This can help stop the spread of germs and prevent the flu.

    "disease": "Flu Shot",
    "summary": "What is the flu? The flu (influenza) is a respiratory infection. It is caused by influenza viruses that infect your nose, throat, and lungs. These viruses can spread from person to person.  Most people with the flu get better on their own, without medical care. But for some people, the flu is serious. It can cause complications and sometimes even death. People who are 65 and older, under age 5, pregnant, or have certain health conditions are at higher risk of flu complications.  Getting vaccinated against the flu each year is best way to lower your risk of the flu and its complications.  What are the benefits of getting a flu shot? There are many reasons to get a flu shot each year:  It may keep you from getting sick with the flu. If you do get the flu, it may be less severe. You may also be less likely to have complications or need to be hospitalized with the flu. If you have certain chronic health conditions, getting a flu shot may help prevent the flu from making your condition worse. For example, if you have COPD or diabetes, the flu can worsen your condition so much that you might need to be hospitalized. Getting a flu shot can lower this risk. Getting the vaccine during pregnancy not only helps protect you from the flu during and after pregnancy. It also helps protect your baby from flu during their first few months of life. It has been shown to lower the risk of severe life-threatening flu in children. It may also protect the people around you, including those who are at higher risk of complications.   How do flu shots work? The flu vaccine causes your immune system to make antibodies about two weeks after you get the shot. These antibodies provide protection against infection with the flu viruses that are in the vaccine.  Who needs a flu shot? The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends annual flu shots for everyone 6 months and older, with a few rare exceptions.   Flu shots are especially important for people who are at high risk of developing serious complications from the flu.  There are different types of flu vaccines. There are injectable vaccines (shots) and nasal spray vaccines.  There are also some vaccines especially for people 65 and older. Ask your health care provider which one is right for you.  Who should not get a flu shot? There are some people who should not get a flu shot:  Children younger than 6 months of age. Have severe, life-threatening allergies to flu vaccine or any ingredient in the vaccine. This might include gelatin, antibiotics, or other ingredients.   Some people need to talk to their provider before they get a flu shot. They include people who:  Have an allergy to any of the ingredients in the vaccine. Have ever had Guillain-Barre syndrome(GBS). Some people with a history of GBS should not get a flu vaccine.   If you are moderately or severely ill, you usually need to wait until you recover before getting a flu shot.  Why do I need a flu shot every year? You need to get a flu shot every year because:  Your immune protection from the vaccine declines over time. You need to get the shot every year to boost that protection. Flu viruses are constantly changing, so every year, the flu vaccine is updated. The flu vaccine will include protection against the viruses that will most likely be common during the upcoming flu season.   When should I get the flu shot? For most people who need only one dose of the flu vaccine for the season, September and October are usually good times to get it. It's best to be vaccinated by the end of October.  Some children need two doses of the flu vaccine. They should get their first dose as soon as the vaccine is available. They need to get the second dose at least four weeks after the first.  If you are pregnant, talk to your provider about when to get the vaccine. When you should get it can vary, based on how far along you are in your pregnancy.  Do flu shots cause side effects? Flu vaccines have been shown to be safe. But like any medical product, they can cause side effects. If you have any side effects, they are usually mild and go away on their own within a few days. Common side effects include:  Soreness, redness, and/or swelling from the shot Headache Fever Nausea Muscle aches   The flu shot, like other injections, can occasionally cause fainting. In rare cases, some people have a serious allergic reaction.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

    "disease": "Fluid and Electrolyte Balance",
    "summary": "What are electrolytes? Electrolytes are minerals that have an electric charge when they are dissolved in water or body fluids, including blood. The electric charge can be positive or negative. You have electrolytes in your blood, urine (pee), tissues, and other body fluids.   Electrolytes are important because they help:  Balance the amount of water in your body Balance your body's acid/base (pH) level Move nutrients into your cells Move wastes out of your cells Support your muscle and nerve function Keep your heart rate and rhythm steady  Keep your blood pressure stable Keep your bones and teeth healthy   What are the different types of electrolytes in your body? The main electrolytes in your body include:  Bicarbonate, which helps maintain the body's acid and base balance (pH). It also plays an important role in moving carbon dioxide through the bloodstream. Calcium, which helps make and keep bones and teeth strong. Chloride, which also helps control the amount of fluid in the body. In addition, it helps maintain healthy blood volume and blood pressure. Magnesium, which helps your muscles, nerves, and heart work properly. It also helps control blood pressure and blood glucose (blood sugar). Phosphate, which works together with calcium to build strong bones and teeth. Potassium, which helps your cells, heart, and muscles work properly. Sodium, which helps control the amount of fluid in the body. It also helps your nerves and muscles work properly.   You get these electrolytes from the foods you eat and the fluids you drink.  What is an electrolyte imbalance? An electrolyte imbalance means that the level of one or more electrolytes in your body is too low or too high. It can happen when the amount of water in your body changes. The amount of water that you take in should equal the amount you lose. If something upsets this balance, you may have too little water (dehydration) or too much water (overhydration). Some of the more common reasons why you might have an imbalance of the water in your body include:   Certain medicines Severe vomiting and/or diarrhea Heavy sweating Heart, liver or kidney problems Not drinking enough fluids, especially when doing intense exercise or when the weather is very hot Drinking too much water   What are the different types of electrolyte imbalances? The names of the different types of electrolyte imbalances are:                            Electrolyte             Too low             Too high                                         Bicarbonate             Acidosis                    Alkalosis                               Calcium             Hypocalcemia                    Hypercalcemia                                 Chloride             Hypochloremia                    Hyperchloremia                                 Magnesium             Hypomagnesemia                    Hypermagnesemia                                      Phosphate             Hypophosphatemia                    Hyperphosphatemia                                 Potassium             Hypokalemia                    Hyperkalemia                                      Sodium             Hyponatremia                    Hypernatremia                    How are electrolyte imbalances diagnosed? A test called an electrolyte panel can check the levels of your body's main electrolytes. A related test, the anion gap blood test, checks whether your electrolytes are out of balance or if your blood is too acidic or not acidic enough.  What are the treatments for electrolyte imbalances? The treatment for an electrolyte imbalance depends on which electrolytes are out of balance, if there is too little or too many, and what is causing the imbalance. In minor cases, you may just need to make some changes to your diet. In other cases, you may need other treatments. For example:  If you don't have enough of an electrolyte, you may get electrolyte replacement therapy. This involves giving you more of that electrolyte. It could be a medicine or supplement that you swallow or drink, or it may be given intravenously (by IV).  If you have too much of an electrolyte, your provider may give you medicines or fluids (by mouth or by IV) to help remove that electrolyte from your body. In severe cases, you may need dialysis to filter out the electrolyte.",

Most food allergies are caused by:  Cow's milk Chicken eggs Crustacean shellfish, such as shrimp, crab, lobster, and crayfish Fish Peanuts Sesame Soy Tree nuts, such as almonds, walnuts, pecans Wheat  People with a food allergy may be allergic to more than one type of food.  Who is more likely to develop a food allergy?  Both children and adults can have food allergies. Some children will outgrow their food allergies. And sometimes people can develop food allergies as adult.  Certain factors can make you more likely to have a food allergy.

If you are allergic to a food you have eaten, you may have a variety of symptoms. These symptoms are not always the same for every person. And the symptoms that you get each time you eat the food may not always be the same. For example, your symptoms may sometimes depend on how much of the food you ate.  Food allergy symptoms usually start within a few minutes to two hours after you eat that food. They may include:  Hives Flushed skin or rash Tingling or itchy sensation in the mouth Face, tongue, or lip swelling Vomiting and/or diarrhea Abdominal (belly) cramps Coughing or wheezing Dizziness and/or lightheadedness Swelling of the throat and vocal cords Trouble breathing   In rare cases, a food allergy can cause a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. It may start out with some milder symptoms, but then it becomes more serious. It can lead to:  Narrowed airways in the lungs Severe trouble breathing because of swelling in the throat  Severe lowering of blood pressure and shock (\"anaphylactic shock\") Loss of consciousness  This is a medical emergency.

An oral food challenge test is the most accurate food allergy test.   What are the treatments for food allergies? There is no cure for food allergies. The only way to prevent a reaction is to avoid eating the food that you are allergic to.   There are medicines for people with food allergies. They include:  Medicines to reduce food allergy symptoms, including antihistamines and corticosteroids.  Medicines to reduce allergic reactions, including severe reactions.

Since they can sometimes be serious, it's important to get medical care right away if you think you have a fracture.  What are the different types of fractures? There are different ways to describe fractures. For example, there are different types of fractures based on:  Whether the bone is partially or completely broken. Whether the bone breaks through the skin; if it does, it's called an open (or compound) fracture. If not, it's a closed fracture. The direction or shape of the break, for example if it's in a line across the bone or if it has some kind of pattern. The cause of the break. For example, a stress fracture is a small break in a bone that is often caused by overuse. Which bone is broken, for example facial fractures include nose and jaw fractures.   What causes fractures? Fractures commonly happen because of car accidents, falls, or sports injuries. Overuse and repetitive motions can also cause fractures.   Low bone density and osteoporosis are conditions which cause weakening of your bones. Having one of these conditions makes you much more likely to break a bone.  What are the symptoms of a fracture? The symptoms of a fracture can vary, depending on which bone you broke. But they may include:  Intense pain Deformity, for example a limb that looks out of place Swelling, bruising, or tenderness around the injury Trouble moving the injured part   If you think that you may have broken a bone, get medical care right away.  How are fractures diagnosed?  To find out if you have a fracture, your health provider will do a physical exam and ask about your injury. They will also likely order an x-ray or other imaging test to see if your bone is broken.  What are the treatments for fractures? The most common treatment for a fracture is for you to wear a cast or a splint. This will keep your bone from moving while it heals. How long you need to wear it will depend on the type of fracture and which bone is affected. But it's often for several weeks. Your provider will let you know when you can get it off.  In some cases, you may need surgery to put in plates, pins, or screws to keep the bone in place.  Can fractures be prevented? There are steps you can take to lower your risk of fractures:  Keeping your bones strong by:      Getting enough calcium and vitamin D in your diet   Getting regular physical activity, including weight bearing exercises such as walking, tennis, and dancing   Getting treatment for low bone density or osteoporosis (if needed)     Wearing protective equipment when you do sports Preventing falls by:      Getting rid of any tripping hazards in your home   Being careful when walking on wet or icy surfaces   Choosing the right footwear",

    "summary": "What are genes? Genes are sections of DNA in your cells that are passed down (inherited) from your parents. You inherit two copies of each gene, one from each parent. Genes carry information that controls what you look like and how your body works.   There are about 20,000 genes that provide instructions for making proteins, which your body needs to work correctly.   Some genes don't make proteins themselves but instead help control how other genes work. They act like switches, turning other genes on or off. This means they help decide when, where, and how much of a protein is made in your body.   What happens when genes change? Changes in your genes are also called gene variants or mutations. These changes can be inherited, occur as you age, or result from environmental factors such as chemicals or radiation. Often, these changes have no effect, but sometimes, even a small change in the DNA can alter the instructions for making proteins. If genes don't make the right proteins, or don't make them correctly, this can cause a genetic disorder.   What is gene therapy? Gene therapy uses genes to treat or prevent disease by correcting genetic problems. It works by changing your genetic material, rather than relying on traditional treatments like medicine or surgery.   New genetic material can be delivered into cells in two main ways:   ex-vivo treatment. Cells are removed from your body, modified by adding genetic material, and then placed back into your body. in-vivo treatment. Genetic material is delivered directly into your body, often through an injection.   A common form of gene therapy involves inserting a normal gene to replace an abnormal gene. Other approaches include:  Repairing an abnormal gene  Altering the degree to which a gene is turned on or off    Newer techniques offer different ways to correct genetic problems:  Genome editing (also called gene editing). Instead of adding new genetic material into cells, this approach changes the DNA that's already in your cells. A well-known example is CRISPR-Cas9. This promising technique is still being studied and may soon be used to treat genetic disorders.  Cell-based gene therapy combines gene therapy and cell therapy. An example of this would be CAR T cell therapy. Cells, which are often immune system cells, are genetically altered to help treat a disease and then introduced into the body.    Gene therapies are currently only approved to treat a small number of diseases, such as:  Leber congenital amaurosis, an inherited eye disorder. Spinal muscular atrophy, a genetic muscle disorder.   What are the risks and challenges of gene therapy? While gene therapy holds great promise, it comes with risks and challenges. Studies are still ongoing to ensure these treatments are safe and effective. Some challenges include:  Immune system reactions. Your body may see the new material as a threat and react to it. Unintended effects. Changes to DNA could affect other genes in harmful ways. High costs. Gene therapies are often expensive and are not widely accessible.",

Genes are parts of DNA found in your cells that carry instructions for how your body grows, develops, and functions. Many genes tell your body how to make proteins, which are needed for your body to work properly.   What causes genetic disorders? A genetic disorder happens when a gene variant changes how a protein is made. The variant may cause the protein to work poorly or not be made at all. If genes don't make the right proteins, or don't make them correctly, it can lead to a genetic disorder.  Not all gene changes cause disease. Often, these changes have no effect. But sometimes, even a small change in DNA can affect how proteins are made.   Gene variants can be grouped into two main types:  Inherited variants (also called germline variants) are passed down from your parents. They come from egg or sperm cells.  Non-inherited (also called somatic variants) are not passed down from your parents. They happen during your lifetime. They may be caused by things like harmful chemicals or ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun.    What are the types of genetic disorders?  Genetic disorders may be caused by:   Single gene disorders are caused by changes in one gene. Examples can include sickle cell anemia, where a change in a single gene can cause the condition, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, where a variant in one of many different genes can cause the condition. Chromosomal disorders are caused by missing, extra, or altered chromosomes. Chromosomes are structures that carry genes. These disorders involve changes in the number of chromosomes people have or changes in the structure of one or more chromosomes. An example is Down syndrome, which is caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. Complex (multifactorial) disorders are caused by changes in many genes. Each change alone may not cause the disease, but together they increase the risk. Lifestyle and environmental factors, such as exercise, diet, or exposure to pollutants, also play a role. Colon cancer is an example.   What are the different ways a genetic disorder can be inherited? Some genetic conditions are passed down through families (inherited) in one of several patterns, depending on the specific gene involved.  Patterns of inheritance can include:  Dominant means you only need one changed gene to cause the condition. Recessive means you need two changed copies of the gene (one from each parent) for the condition to occur. X-linked conditions involve genes located on the X chromosome. These conditions often affect males more frequently. Mitochondrial conditions are passed down by the mother.   How are genetic disorders diagnosed?

Each chromosome is made up of DNA tightly packaged around proteins. People usually have 23 pairs of chromosomes that contain all their DNA.    What are the different ways to get genetic tests? Most of the time, genetic testing is done through your health care provider. This is called clinical testing. It is done to find out about an inherited disorder (passed down through families) and to help make decisions about your care.   Other ways to get genetic testing include:  Research-based testing is a genetic test done as part of a research study (clinical trial).  Direct-to-consumer (DTC) testing is a genetic test that allows you to send a DNA sample and get the results. You may do this to learn about your ancestry or your risk for certain diseases.   Why is genetic testing done? Genetic testing may be done for many different reasons, including to:  Find genetic diseases in a fetus. This is a type of prenatal testing. Screen newborn babies for certain treatable conditions. Lower the risk of genetic diseases in embryos that were created using assisted reproductive technology. Find out if you carry a gene for a certain disease that could be passed on to your children. This is called carrier testing. See whether you are at an increased risk of getting a specific disease. This may be done for a disease that runs in your family. Diagnose certain diseases. Identify genetic changes that may be causing or contributing to a disease that you were already diagnosed with. Help guide your provider in deciding the best medicine and dosage for you. This is called pharmacogenomic testing. To check for, monitor, or manage a disease. This is sometimes used to help find the best cancer treatment.  To confirm the biological father (paternity) of a child, or how much genetic information is shared with other relatives.  To explore the likelihood of having or developing certain physical traits, such as hair color or facial dimples, or to learn about your ancestry.  To help advance our understanding of genetic conditions, learn how genes work, and find unknown genes.   How is genetic testing done? Genetic tests are often done on a blood or cheek swab sample. But they may also be done on samples of hair, saliva, skin, amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds a fetus during pregnancy), or other tissue. The sample is sent to a laboratory. There, a lab technician will use one of several different techniques to look for genetic changes.  What are the benefits of genetic testing? The benefits of genetic testing include:  Helping your provider make recommendations for the management or monitoring of a genetic condition. Giving you more information for making decisions about your health and your family's health: \t \t\tIf you find out that you are at risk for a certain disease, you might take steps to lower that risk. For example, you may find out that you should be screened for a disease earlier and more often. Or you might decide to make healthy lifestyle changes. \t\tIf you find out that you are not at risk for a certain disease, then you can talk to your provider about when it would be appropriate to schedule checkups or screenings.  \t\tA test could give you information that helps you make decisions about having children. \t  Identifying genetic disorders early in life so that treatment can start as soon as possible.   What are the drawbacks of genetic testing? The physical risks of the different types of genetic testing are small. But there can be emotional, social, or financial drawbacks:  Depending on the results, you may feel angry, depressed, anxious, or guilty. This can be especially true if you are diagnosed with a disease that does not have effective treatments. Despite the protections that are in place, you may be worried about genetic discrimination in employment or insurance.  Genetic testing may give you limited information about a genetic disease. For example, it cannot tell you whether you will have symptoms, how severe a disease might be, or whether a disease will get worse over time.  Genetic testing results might be inconclusive. For example, you might keep getting negative results or not get an answer at all.  Some genetic tests may give you results that you didn't expect. For example, if you are tested to check for the cause of a rare disease, and a different variant is found that puts you at increased risk for something else that was previously unknown.  Some genetic tests are expensive, and health insurance might only cover part of the cost. Or they may not cover it at all.   How do I decide whether to be tested? The decision about whether to have genetic testing is complex. In addition to discussing the test with your provider, you can meet with a genetic counselor. Genetic counselors have specialized degrees and experience in genetics and counseling. They can help you understand the tests and weigh the risks and benefits. If you do take a test, they can explain the results and make sure that you have the support that you need.",

You can get it from having vaginal, anal, or oral sex with someone who has it. The virus can spread even when sores are not present. Mothers can also infect their babies during childbirth.  Symptoms of herpes are called outbreaks.  You usually get sores near the area where the virus has entered the body. The sores are blisters which break and become painful, and then heal. Sometimes people do not know they have herpes because they have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. The virus can be more serious in newborn babies or in people with weak immune systems.  Repeat outbreaks are common, especially during the first year. Over time, you get them less often and the symptoms become milder.  The virus stays in your body for life.  There are tests that can diagnose genital herpes. There is no cure.  However, medicines can help lessen symptoms, decrease outbreaks, and lower the risk of passing the virus to others. Correct usage of latex condoms can reduce, but not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading herpes. If you or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.

Some types of HPV can cause genital warts. Other types of HPV can cause cancer.   There is no treatment for HPV, but your health care provider can treat genital warts. HPV vaccines may help prevent some of the HPV infections that cause genital warts.  Who is at risk for genital warts? If you are sexually active, you can get genital warts during oral, vaginal, or anal sex with an infected partner. You can still get genital warts even if they are so small that you can't see them.  It doesn't happen often, but genital warts can also be spread from a woman to her baby during childbirth.  What are the symptoms of genital warts? Genital warts are often painless and may not cause any symptoms. You might not even know that you have them. Sometimes, they can also cause itching, burning, bleeding, or discomfort.   The warts usually appear as a small bump or group of bumps in the genital area. They are flesh-colored and can be flat or look bumpy like cauliflower.  How are genital warts diagnosed? Your provider can usually find out if you have genital warts by seeing them during a physical exam or pelvic exam. In women, the warts usually occur in or around the vagina, on the cervix, or around the anus. Men may have warts on the tip of the penis, around the anus, or on the scrotum, thigh, or groin.   What are the treatments for genital warts? The warts might disappear on their own, stay the same, or grow bigger or increase in number. A few ways that your provider can treat them include:  Use medicines, cream, or ointment Remove them by burning, freezing, or cutting out the warts    HPV stays in your body even after treatment. This means that warts can come back, and you can still spread HPV to others after genital warts are removed.  Can genital warts be prevented? Getting an HPV vaccine may help prevent genital warts. HPV vaccines provide the most protection if you get them before exposure to the virus. This means that it's best to get vaccinated before becoming sexually active. If you're over age 26 and haven't been vaccinated, talk with your provider about the possible benefits of vaccination.  Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading HPV. If you or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.

    "summary": "What is GERD? Sometimes, after eating a large meal or lying down too soon after eating, you might feel acid coming up into your throat. This is called gastroesophageal reflux (GER). It happens when the muscle at the end of your esophagus (the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach) doesn't close properly. Stomach contents can then move back up and irritate the esophagus.   Having reflux occasionally is common. But if you have symptoms two or more times a week or if they cause damage to the lining of your esophagus, you may have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). GERD is a chronic (long-lasting) condition that can cause discomfort and, over time, lead to other health problems.   Anyone can have GERD, including infants and children.    What causes GERD? GERD can happen when the muscle at the bottom of your esophagus becomes weak or relaxes at the wrong time. You are more likely to have GERD if you:  Are overweight or have obesity Are pregnant Smoke or are around secondhand smoke Have a hiatal hernia (when part of the stomach pushes up into the chest)   Certain foods, drinks, or medicines can also make GERD worse.   What are common symptoms of GERD? The most common symptom of GERD is heartburn. This is a burning feeling in your chest or throat. You can also have GERD without having heartburn. Other symptoms may include:  Tasting acid or food in the back of your mouth A dry cough or hoarse voice Asthma-like symptoms Trouble swallowing   Get medical help right away if you have chest pain with shortness of breath, or pain in your jaw or arm. These can be signs of a heart problem.  How is GERD diagnosed? Your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and medical history. They may recommend tests such as:  Upper GI endoscopy to look at the esophagus and stomach lining with a tiny camera.  Biopsy to check a small tissue sample. X-Ray to take pictures of the upper digestive system. Esophageal pH test to measure how often acid backs up the esophagus and how long the acid stays there.  Esophageal manometry to check how well your esophagus moves food when you swallow. Transnasal esophagoscopy to look for damage to the esophagus by using a small tube with a camera.   How is GERD treated? Most people can manage GERD with lifestyle changes and medicine. In rare cases, surgery is needed.  Lifestyle changes can include:  Eating smaller meals and avoiding lying down for at least 2-3 hours after eating Avoiding foods that trigger symptoms, such as spicy foods, chocolate, caffeine, or fatty foods Losing weight if needed Raising the head of your bed Quitting smoking   Medicines can include:  Over-the-counter medicines, such as antacids Prescription medicines   If not treated, GERD can cause problems like inflammation of the esophagus, scarring, or changes in the tissue lining (Barrett's esophagus). It can also worsen asthma or cause chronic (long-term) cough or hoarseness.   Can GERD be prevented? You may be able to improve symptoms of GERD by:  Avoiding alcohol and trigger foods  Eating smaller meals Not eating close to bedtime Wearing loose-fitting clothes Sleeping on your left side or raising the head of your bed Maintaining a healthy weight    NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

There are different types of glaucoma, but the most common type is open-angle glaucoma. Other less common types include angle-closure glaucoma, and congenital glaucoma. You may not have any symptoms of glaucoma. Regular eye exams by an eye care provider can check for glaucoma and other eye problems to help protect your vision. Treatments that lower eye pressure help slow the disease. Without treatment, glaucoma can eventually lead to blindness.  What causes glaucoma? Medical experts aren't sure what causes glaucoma, but the most common types usually happen when the fluid pressure inside your eye slowly rises, damaging the optic nerve. Other types of glaucoma may be caused by medical conditions, or a baby may be born with it.  Not everyone with high eye pressure develops glaucoma. Some people may even get glaucoma with normal eye pressure. The amount of pressure your optic nerve can handle is different for each person. Getting regular dilated eye exams helps your provider figure out what level of eye pressure is normal for you.  What are the symptoms of glaucoma? Often there are no symptoms of glaucoma at first. Or symptoms may start so slowly that you may not notice them. Without treatment, you slowly lose your peripheral (side) vision. It may seem like you're looking through a tunnel. Over time, your straight-ahead vision may decrease until no vision remains. If you have sudden symptoms of intense eye pain, blurry vision, red eyes, or an upset stomach (nausea), you need to go to your eye care provider or an emergency room right away. These could be symptoms of angle-closure glaucoma. This less common type of glaucoma causes fluid to build up quickly in your eye.   How is glaucoma diagnosed? A comprehensive eye exam can tell if you have glaucoma. This would include:  A dilated eye exam. This involves getting eye drops that dilate (widen) your pupils. This allows more light to enter your eye. Your eye care provider examines your eyes using a special magnifying lens. This provides a clear view of important tissues at the back of your eye to check for glaucoma or other eye problems. For a few hours after the exam your vision may be blurry and sensitive to light, so you will need someone to take you home. Visual field testing. This check of your peripheral (side) vision allows your eye care provider to find out how well you can see objects off to the side of your vision without moving your eyes.  Tonometry. This measures the pressure inside your eye.    If you're at higher risk for glaucoma, you should get comprehensive eye exams every one to two years. You're at higher risk if you:  Are Black or African American and over age 40 Are over age 60, especially if you're Hispanic or Latino Have a family history of glaucoma   You're also at higher risk if you have high blood pressure or diabetes and should get a dilated eye exam at least once a year. Talk with your provider about your risk and how often you should get your eyes checked.  What are the treatments for glaucoma? Early treatment can help protect your eyes against vision loss. There is no cure, but glaucoma can usually be controlled. Without treatment it can eventually cause blindness. Treatments can include:  Prescription eye drops are the most common treatment to lower the pressure in your eye and prevent damage to your optic nerve.  Other treatments may include oral medicines, laser treatment, and/or surgery.   A combination of these treatments may be used to lower eye pressure and help drain the fluid out of your eye.  Can glaucoma be prevented? There is no way to prevent glaucoma. Eye exams can help find glaucoma or other eye problems before they can affect your vision. If you have glaucoma, be sure to continue with treatment to prevent your vision from getting worse.   NIH: National Eye Institute",

    "disease": "Gout",
    "summary": "What is gout? Gout is a common type of inflammatory arthritis. It causes pain, swelling, and redness in one or more joints. It usually happens as a flare, which can last for a week or two and then gets better. The flares often begin in your big toe or a lower limb.  What causes gout? Gout happens when too much uric acid (urate) builds up in your body over a long time. Uric acid is a waste product your body makes when it breaks down purines. Purines are substances that are in your body's tissues and in many foods.  When your body breaks down old cells or digests foods that contain purine, most of the uric acid that's made dissolves in your blood. Your kidneys filter the uric acid out of your blood, and it leaves your body in your urine (pee).  However, sometimes your body can make too much uric acid or does not remove enough of it. Then the uric acid levels build up in your body, including in your blood. Having too much uric acid in the blood is called hyperuricemia. It does not cause health problems for everyone. But in some people, uric acid forms needle-like crystals. They can form in your joints, which causes gout. The crystals can also cause kidney stones.  Calcium pyrophosphate arthritis, sometimes called pseudogout, is a related disease. It causes similar symptoms and is sometimes confused with gout. But it is caused by a buildup of calcium phosphate, not uric acid.  Who is more likely to develop gout?  Many people develop gout. You are more likely to get it if you:  Are male. Are older; it usually develops in middle age. Have obesity. Have certain health conditions, such as:      Heart failure   High blood pressure   Metabolic syndrome   Chronic kidney disease   Conditions that cause your cells to break down more quickly, such as psoriasis or some cancers   Rare genetic conditions that lead to increased uric acid     Have a family history of gout. Have an unhealthy diet and eat foods that are rich in purines, such as red meat, organ meats, certain seafoods. Drink alcohol. Eat and drink lots of foods and beverages that contain fructose (a type of sugar). Take certain medicines, such as diuretics (water pills), low-dose aspirin, and some medicines that weaken your immune system. Take high amounts of niacin (vitamin B-3).   What are the symptoms of gout? Gout usually happens in only one joint at a time. It is often found in the big toe, but can also affect other joints, including your other toes, ankle, and knee.  Gout flares often start suddenly at night, and the symptoms in the affected joint often include:  Intense pain, which may be bad enough to wake you up Swelling Redness Warmth   The flares typically get better within a week or two. In between flares, you usually don't have symptoms. Some people may have flares often, while others may not have another flare for years. But over time, if left untreated, your flares may happen more often and last longer.   And if gout is untreated over long periods of time, you can develop tophi. Tophi are hard, uric acid deposits under the skin. They start out as painless, but over time, they can become painful. They can also cause bone and soft tissue damage and misshapen joints.  How is gout diagnosed? To find out if you have gout, your health care provider:  Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. Will do a physical exam, including examining the affected joint(s). May order various tests, such as:      A test of a sample of fluid from one of your painful joints. The fluid is examined under a microscope and is checked for uric acid crystals.   A uric acid blood or urine test.   An ultrasound or special CT scan to look for uric acid crystal buildup in the affected joint and check for other conditions that may be causing the symptoms.       What are the treatments for gout? There are effective treatments for gout. Which treatment you get will depend on your symptoms and the cause of your gout. The goals of your treatment will be to:  Reduce the pain from gout flares, by using medicines such as:      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen.   Acetaminophen and the anti-inflammatory drug colchicine.   Oral or injected corticosteroids.     Prevent future flares, for example by:      Making lifestyle changes such as losing weight, limiting alcohol, and avoiding foods high in purines. If you are taking medicines that can cause high uric acid in the blood, your provider may suggest stopping or changing those medicines.   If needed, taking medicines to lower uric acid in the blood.     Prevent tophi and kidney stones, for example with medicines that lower uric acid in the blood.   With early diagnosis, treatment, and lifestyle changes, gout is one of the most controllable forms of arthritis. Treatment and lifestyle changes may help people avoid gout flares, lessen their symptoms, and sometimes even become gout free.

Some children are short or tall because their parents are.  But some children have growth disorders.  Growth disorders are problems that prevent children from developing normal height, weight, sexual maturity or other features.  Very slow or very fast growth can sometimes signal a gland problem or disease.    The pituitary gland makes growth hormone, which stimulates the growth of bone and other tissues. Children who have too little of it may be very short. Treatment with growth hormone can stimulate growth.   People can also have too much growth hormone.  Usually the cause is a pituitary gland tumor, which is not cancer.  Too much growth hormone can cause gigantism in children, where their bones and their body grow too much.  In adults, it can cause acromegaly, which makes the hands, feet and face larger than normal. Possible treatments include surgery to remove the tumor, medicines, and radiation therapy.",

    "disease": "Guide to Good Posture",
    "summary": "Good posture is about more than standing up straight so you can look your best. It is an important part of your long-term health. Making sure that you hold your body the right way, whether you are moving or still, can prevent pain, injuries, and other health problems.  What is posture? Posture is how you hold your body. There are two types: Dynamic posture is how you hold yourself when you are moving, like when you are walking, running, or bending over to pick up something. Static posture is how you hold yourself when you are not moving, like when you are sitting, standing, or sleeping.   It is important to make sure that you have good dynamic and static posture.  The key to good posture is the position of your spine. Your spine has three natural curves - at your neck, mid back, and low back. Correct posture should maintain these curves, but not increase them. Your head should be above your shoulders, and the top of your shoulder should be over the hips.  How can posture affect my health? Poor posture can be bad for your health. Slouching or slumping over can: Misalign your musculoskeletal system Wear away at your spine, making it more fragile and prone to injury Cause neck, shoulder, and back pain Decrease your flexibility Affect how well your joints move Affect your balance and increase your risk of falling Make it harder to digest your food Make it harder to breathe   How can I improve my posture in general?   Be mindful of your posture during everyday activities, like watching television, washing dishes, or walking Stay active. Any kind of exercise may help improve your posture, but certain types of exercises can be especially helpful. They include yoga, tai chi, and other classes that focus on body awareness. It is also a good idea to do exercises that strengthen your core (muscles around your back, abdomen, and pelvis). Maintain a healthy weight. Extra weight can weaken your abdominal muscles, cause problems for your pelvis and spine, and contribute to low back pain. All of these can hurt your posture. Wear comfortable, low-heeled shoes. High heels, for example, can throw off your balance and force you to walk differently. This puts more stress on your muscles and harms your posture. Make sure work surfaces are at a comfortable height for you, whether you're sitting in front of a computer, making dinner, or eating a meal.   How can I improve my posture when sitting? Many Americans spend a lot of their time sitting - either at work, at school, or at home. It is important to sit properly, and to take frequent breaks: Switch sitting positions often Take brief walks around your office or home Gently stretch your muscles every so often to help relieve muscle tension Don't cross your legs; keep your feet on the floor, with your ankles in front of your knees Make sure that your feet touch the floor, or if that's not possible, use a footrest Relax your shoulders; they should not be rounded or pulled backwards Keep your elbows in close to your body. They should be bent between 90 and 120 degrees. Make sure that your back is fully supported. Use a back pillow or other back support if your chair does not have a backrest that can support your lower back's curve. Make sure that your thighs and hips are supported. You should have a well-padded seat, and your thighs and hips should be parallel to the floor.    How can I improve my posture when standing?   Stand up straight and tall Keep your shoulders back Pull your stomach in Put your weight mostly on the balls of your feet Keep your head level Let your arms hang down naturally at your sides Keep your feet about shoulder-width apart    With practice, you can improve your posture; you will look and feel better.",

The first symptom is usually weakness or a tingling feeling in your legs. The feeling can spread to your upper body. In severe cases, you become almost paralyzed. This is life-threatening. You might need a respirator to breathe. Symptoms usually worsen over a period of weeks and then stabilize.   Guillain-Barre can be hard to diagnose.

    "disease": "HDL: The \"Good\" Cholesterol",
    "summary": "What is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But having too much cholesterol in your blood raises your risk of coronary artery disease.   What are HDL and LDL? HDL and LDL are two types of lipoproteins.They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein.  The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. HDL and LDL have different purposes: HDL stands for high-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body. LDL stands for low-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries.     How do I know what my HDL level is? A blood test can measure your cholesterol levels, including HDL. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history.  The general recommendations are:  For people who are age 19 or younger:: The first test should be between ages 9 to 11 Children should have the test again every 5 years Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke   For people who are age 20 or older:: Younger adults should have the test every 5 years Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years   What should my HDL level be?  With HDL cholesterol, higher numbers are better, because a high HDL level can lower your risk for coronary artery disease and stroke. How high your HDL should be depends on your age and sex:                            Group             Healthy HDL Level                                         Age 19 or younger             More than 45mg/dl                               Men age 20 or older             More than 40mg/dl                               Women age 20 or older             More than 50mg/dl                   How can I raise my HDL level? If your HDL level is too low, lifestyle changes may help. These changes may also help prevent other diseases, and make you feel better overall: Eat a healthy diet. To raise your HDL level, you need to eat good fats instead of bad fats. This means limiting saturated fats, which include full-fat milk and cheese, high-fat meats like sausage and bacon, and foods made with butter, lard, and shortening. You should also avoid trans fats, which may be in some margarines, fried foods, and processed foods like baked goods. Instead, eat unsaturated fats, which are found in avocado, vegetable oils like olive oil, and nuts. Limit carbohydrates, especially sugar. Also try to eat more foods naturally high in fiber, such as oatmeal and beans. Stay at a healthy weight. You can boost your HDL level by losing weight, especially if you have lots of fat around your waist.\t Exercise. Getting regular exercise can raise your HDL level, as well as lower your LDL. You should try to do 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise on most, if not all, days.   Avoid cigarettes. Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke can lower your HDL level. If you are a smoker, ask your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit. You should also try to avoid secondhand smoke. Limit alcohol. Moderate alcohol may lower your HDL level, although more studies are needed to confirm that. What we do know is that too much alcohol can make you gain weight, and that lowers your HDL level.   Some cholesterol medicines, including certain statins, can raise your HDL level, in addition to lowering your LDL level. Health care providers don't usually prescribe medicines only to raise HDL. But if you have a low HDL and high LDL level, you might need medicine.  What else can affect my HDL level? Taking certain medicines can lower HDL levels in some people. They include: Beta blockers, a type of blood pressure medicine Anabolic steroids, including testosterone, a male hormone Progestins, which are female hormones that are in some birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy Benzodiazepines, sedatives that are often used for anxiety and insomnia   If you are taking one of these and you have a very low HDL level, ask your provider if you should continue to take them.  Diabetes can also lower your HDL level, so that gives you another reason to manage your diabetes.",

How is head and neck cancer diagnosed? Which exams and tests used to diagnose head and neck cancer can depend on the specific type of cancer. Possible exams and tests may include:  A physical exam of the area that might have cancer. Blood and/or urine tests. An endoscopy. A biopsy or other procedure to collect cells from the area that might have cancer. The cells are viewed under a microscope to find out if they are abnormal. Imaging tests.   What are the treatments for head and neck cancer? The treatment for head and neck cancer will depend on the specific type of cancer, the stage (how advanced the cancer is), your overall health, and other factors. The treatment options might include:  Surgery Radiation therapy Chemotherapy Cancer immunotherapy Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that mainly attack specific cancer cells and cause less harm to normal cells   In some cases, you may need a combination of treatments. Sometimes surgery can affect how well you can chew, swallow, or talk. Rehabilitation, such as physical therapy, dietary counseling, and speech therapy, may help.

    "disease": "Head Lice",
    "summary": "What are head lice? Head lice are tiny insects that live on people's heads. Adult lice are about the size of sesame seeds. The eggs, called nits, are even smaller - about the size of a dandruff flake. Lice and nits are found on or near the scalp, most often at the neckline and behind the ears.  Head lice are parasites, and they need to feed on human blood to survive. They are one of the three types of lice that live on humans. The other two types are body lice and pubic lice. Each type of lice is different, and getting one type does not mean that you will get another type.  How do head lice spread? Lice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. They spread by close person-to-person contact. Rarely, they can spread through sharing personal belongings such as hats or hairbrushes. Personal hygiene and cleanliness have nothing to do with getting head lice. You also cannot get pubic lice from animals. Head lice do not spread disease.  Who is at risk for head lice? Children ages 3-11 and their families get head lice most often. This is because young children often have head-to-head contact while playing together.  What are the symptoms of head lice? The symptoms of head lice include: Tickling feeling in the hair Frequent itching, which is caused by an allergic reaction to the bites Sores from scratching. Sometimes the sores can become infected with bacteria. Trouble sleeping, because head lice are most active in the dark    How do you know if you have head lice? A diagnosis of head lice usually comes from seeing a louse or nit. Because they are very small and move quickly, you may need to use a magnifying lens and a fine-toothed comb to find lice or nits.  What are the treatments for head lice? Treatments for head lice include both over-the-counter and prescription shampoos, creams, and lotions. If you want to use an over-the-counter treatment and you aren't sure which one to use or how to use one, ask your health care provider or pharmacist. You should also check with your health care provider first if you are pregnant or nursing, or if you want to use a treatment on a young child.  Follow these steps when using a head lice treatment: Apply the product according to the instructions. Only apply it to the scalp and the hair attached to the scalp. You should not use it on other body hair. Use only one product at a time, unless your health care provider tells you to use two different kinds at once Pay attention to what the instructions say about how long you should leave the medicine on the hair and on how you should rinse it out After rinsing, use a fine-toothed comb or special \"nit comb\" to remove dead lice and nits After each treatment, check your hair for lice and nits.  You should comb your hair to remove nits and lice every 2-3 days. Do this for 2-3 weeks to be sure that all lice and nits are gone.    All household members and other close contacts should be checked and treated if necessary. If an over-the-counter treatment does not work for you, you can ask your health care provider for a prescription product.  Can head lice be prevented? There are steps you can take to prevent the spread of lice. If you already have lice, besides treatment, you should: Wash your clothes, bedding, and towels with hot water, and dry them using the hot cycle of the dryer Soak your combs and brushes in hot water for 5-10 minutes Vacuum the floor and furniture, particularly where you sat or lay If there are items that you cannot wash, seal them in a plastic bag for two weeks   To prevent your children from spreading lice: Teach children to avoid head-to-head contact during play and other activities Teach children not to share clothing and other items that they put on their head, such as headphones, hair ties, and helmets If your child has lice, be sure to check the policies at school and/or daycare. Your child may not be able to go back until the lice have been completely treated.   There is no clear scientific evidence that lice can be suffocated by home remedies, such as mayonnaise, olive oil, or similar substances. You also should not use kerosene or gasoline; they are dangerous and flammable.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

    "summary": "What are health problems in pregnancy? A health problem in pregnancy is any disease or condition that could affect your health or the health of your fetus. Some health problems may make it more likely that you will have a high-risk pregnancy. A high-risk pregnancy is one in which you, your fetus, or both are at higher risk for health problems than in a typical pregnancy.  But just because you have health problems, it doesn't mean that you, or your fetus, will have a problem during the pregnancy. Taking care of yourself and getting early and regular prenatal care from a health care provider may help you reduce pregnancy risks from health problems.  What raises my risk for health problems during pregnancy? Every pregnancy has some risk of problems, but your lifestyle, as well as factors like certain conditions and health issues, can raise that risk, such as:  A health condition you had before you got pregnant  A health condition you develop during pregnancy  A pregnancy with more than one baby  A health problem that happened during a previous pregnancy and could happen again   Substance use during pregnancy  Being over age 35    Any of these can affect your health, the health of your fetus, or both.  Can chronic health conditions cause problems in pregnancy? Every pregnancy is different. If you have specific risks in one pregnancy, it doesn't mean that you will have them in another. But, if you have a chronic condition, you should talk to your provider about how to minimize your risk before you get pregnant. Once you are pregnant, you may need a health care team to monitor your pregnancy. Some common conditions that can complicate a pregnancy include:  High blood pressure Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Kidney problems Autoimmune disorders Thyroid disease Obesity HIV Cancer Infections   Other conditions that may make pregnancy risky can develop during pregnancy - for example, gestational diabetes and Rh incompatibility.   Can health problems in pregnancy be prevented? You may be able to lower your risk of certain health problems by making healthy lifestyle changes before you get pregnant. These can include reaching a healthy weight, not smoking, and managing any health conditions.   However, health problems during pregnancy are not always preventable. Some chronic conditions can be treated and controlled, while others aren't treatable and carry a higher risk than usual, even if the health problem is well-managed.   Share your symptoms with your provider for early detection and treatment of health problems. Sometimes, it's hard to know what's normal. Some symptoms, like nausea, back pain, and fatigue, are common during pregnancy, while other symptoms, like vaginal bleeding or a severe or long-lasting headache, can be signs of a problem. Call your provider to let them know if something is bothering or worrying you.",

These all mean the same thing: a lifestyle with a lot of sitting and lying down, with very little or no exercise.   People are spending more time doing sedentary activities. During our leisure time, we are often sitting while using a computer or other device, watching TV, or playing video games. Many of our jobs have become more sedentary, with long days sitting at a desk or while commuting. And the way most of us get around involves sitting - in cars, on buses, and on trains.   How does an inactive lifestyle affect your body?  When you have an inactive lifestyle:  You burn fewer calories. This makes you more likely to gain weight  You may lose muscle strength and endurance, because you are not using your muscles as much Your bones may get weaker and lose some mineral content Your metabolism may be affected, and your body may have more trouble breaking down fats and sugars Your immune system may not work as well You may have poorer blood circulation Your body may have more inflammation You may develop a hormonal imbalance  What are the health risks of an inactive lifestyle?  Having an inactive lifestyle can increase your risk of developing chronic (long-term) diseases. This is sometimes referred to as \"sitting disease\". By not getting regular exercise, you raise your risk of:  Obesity Heart diseases, including coronary artery disease and heart attack High blood pressure High cholesterol Stroke Metabolic syndrome Type 2 diabetes Certain cancers, including colon, breast, and uterine cancers Osteoporosis and falls Increased feelings of depression and anxiety  Having a sedentary lifestyle can also raise your risk of premature death. And the more sedentary you are, the higher your health risks are.  How can I get started with exercise?  If you have been inactive, you may need to start slowly. Your health care provider can help you choose the best type or amount of activity for you based on your fitness level and health. You can keep adding more exercise gradually. The more you can do, the better. But try not to feel overwhelmed and do what you can. Getting some exercise is always better than getting none. Eventually, your goal can be to get the recommended amount of exercise for your age and health.   There are many ways to get exercise; it is important to find the types that are best for you. You can also try to add activity to your life in smaller ways, such as at home and at work.  How can I be more active around the house?  There are some ways you can be active around your house:  Housework, gardening, and yard work are all physical work. To increase the intensity, you could try doing them at a more vigorous pace.  Keep moving while you watch TV. Lift hand weights, do some gentle yoga stretches, or pedal an exercise bike. Work out at home with a workout video (on your TV or on the internet). Go for a walk in your neighborhood. It can be more fun if you walk your dog, walk your kids to school, or walk with a friend. Stand up when talking on the phone. Get some exercise equipment for your home. Treadmills and elliptical trainers are great, but not everyone has the money or space for one. Less expensive equipment such as yoga balls, exercise mats, stretch bands, and hand weights can help you get a workout at home too.   How can I be more active at work?  Most of us sit when we are working, often in front of a computer. It can be challenging to fit physical activity into your busy workday, but here are some tips to help you get moving:  Get up from your chair and move around at least once an hour Park at the back of the parking lot Stand when you are talking on the phone or during a video conference Find out whether your company can get you a stand-up or treadmill desk Take the stairs instead of the elevator Use your break or part of your lunchtime to walk around the building Stand up and walk to a colleague's office instead of sending an email Have \"walking\" or standing meetings with co-workers instead of sitting in a conference room  The good news is that it's never too late to change your exercise habits. You can start slowly and find ways to fit more physical activity into your life. Regular exercise has many benefits and may help prevent or control many diseases.",

    "summary": "What is sleep? While you are sleeping your brain and body functions are still active. Sleep is a natural process that helps your body restore energy, supports learning and memory, and keeps you healthy. During sleep, your brain cycles through different stages of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Non-REM sleep has three stages that range from light to deep sleep, while REM sleep is when most dreaming occurs. During each stage, your brain waves, breathing, heart rate, and body temperature change throughout the night.  Certain phases of sleep help you:  Feel rested and energetic the next day. Learn new information, get insight, and form memories. Give your heart and blood vessels a rest. Release growth hormone, which helps children grow and assists in muscle repair and tissue healing for everyone. Release sex hormones, which contribute to puberty and fertility. Maintain a healthy balance of hormones that control hunger and fullness. Strengthen your immune system by producing cytokines (hormones that help the body fight infection).  You need all the stages to get a healthy sleep.  How much sleep do I need? The amount of sleep you need depends on your age, lifestyle, health, and sleep patterns. The general recommendations for sleep are:  Babies (4-12 months): 12-16 hours a day (including naps) Children (1-2 years): 11-14 hours a day (including naps) Children (3-5 years): 10-13 hours a day (including naps) Children (6-12 years): 9-12 hours a day Teens (13-18 years): 8-10 hours a day Adults (18 years and older): 7-9 hours a day   During puberty, teenagers' biological clocks shift. They tend to fall asleep later and wake up later, which can conflict with the early school start times. This is one reason many teenagers don't get enough sleep.   Some people think adults need less sleep as they age, but there is no evidence to support this. However, older adults often get less sleep or spend less time in the deep, restful stages of sleep. They also wake up more easily. It's not just the number of hours of sleep you get that matters. The quality of the sleep you get is also important. People whose sleep is frequently interrupted might not get enough of certain stages of sleep.  If you are wondering whether you are getting enough sleep, including quality sleep, ask yourself:  Do I have trouble getting up in the morning? Do I have trouble focusing during the day? Do I doze off during the day?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, you may need to improve your sleep habits.  What are the health effects of not getting enough sleep?  Sleep is important for overall health. When you don't get enough sleep (sleep deprivation), it does more than just make you feel tired. It can impair your ability to think clearly, react quickly, and form memories. This increases your risk of making mistakes, taking risks, or getting into accidents.  Sleep deprivation can also affect your mood, leading to:  Irritability Problems with relationships, especially for children and teenagers Depression Anxiety   It can also affect your physical health. Not getting enough sleep, or getting poor-quality sleep, increases your risk of:   High blood pressure Heart disease Stroke Kidney disease Obesity Type 2 diabetes   Not getting enough sleep can also lower your levels of hormones that help children grow and help the body build muscle, repair tissue, and fight infections.  Sleep deprivation also magnifies the effect of alcohol. A tired person who drinks too much alcohol will be more impaired than a well-rested person who drinks the same amount.  How can I get better sleep? You can take steps to improve your sleep habits. First, make sure that you allow yourself enough time for sleep. Getting enough sleep each night may help you feel happier and more productive during the day.  To improve your sleep habits, it also may help to:  Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. Avoid caffeine, especially in the afternoon and evening. Avoid nicotine. Exercise regularly, but not too close to bedtime. Avoid alcoholic drinks before bed. Avoid large meals and drinks late at night. Don't take a nap after 3 p.m. Relax before bed by taking a bath, reading or listening to calm music. Keep your bedroom cool, dark, and quiet. Get rid of distractions such as TVs, computers, and phones. Get enough sunlight exposure during the day. If you can't fall asleep for 20 minutes, get up and do something relaxing. See a health care provider if you have continued trouble sleeping. You may have a sleep disorder, such as insomnia or sleep apnea. In some cases, your provider may suggest trying a sleep study or other treatments.   If you are a shift worker, getting good sleep can be more challenging. You may also want to:  Take naps and extend your total sleep time Keep the lights bright at work Limit shift changes to help your body adjust Limit caffeine to the first part of your shift Remove sound and light distractions in your bedroom during daytime sleep (for example, use light-blocking curtains or earplugs)",

Without the blood coming in, the heart can't get oxygen. If not treated quickly, the heart muscle begins to die. But if you do get quick treatment, you may be able to prevent or limit damage to the heart muscle. That's why it's important to know the symptoms of a heart attack and call 911 if you or someone else is having them. You should call, even if you are not sure that it is a heart attack.  The most common symptoms in men and women are:  Chest discomfort. It is often in center or left side of the chest. It usually lasts more than a few minutes. It may go away and come back. It can feel like pressure, squeezing, fullness, or pain. It also can feel like heartburn or indigestion. Shortness of breath. Sometimes this is your only symptom. You may get it before or during the chest discomfort. It can happen when you are resting or doing a little bit of physical activity. Discomfort in the upper body. You may feel pain or discomfort in one or both arms, the back, shoulders, neck, jaw, or upper part of the stomach.   You may also have other symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, dizziness, and lightheadedness. You may break out in a cold sweat. Sometimes women will have different symptoms then men. For example, they are more likely to feel tired for no reason.  The most common cause of heart attacks is coronary artery disease (CAD). With CAD, there is a buildup of cholesterol and other material, called plaque, on their inner walls or the arteries. This is atherosclerosis. It can build up for years. Eventually an area of plaque can rupture (break open). A blood clot can form around the plaque and block the artery.  A less common cause of heart attack is a severe spasm (tightening) of a coronary artery. The spasm cuts off blood flow through the artery.  At the hospital, health care providers make a diagnosis based on your symptoms, blood tests, and different heart health tests. Treatments may include medicines and medical procedures such as coronary angioplasty. After a heart attack, cardiac rehabilitation and lifestyle changes can help you recover.

In the United States, heart disease is the number one cause of death in women. But women are often not diagnosed with heart disease as quickly as men are. That's because:  Women are more likely than men to have \"silent\" heart disease, meaning that they don't have symptoms.  Health care providers may not recognize heart disease in women because women's symptoms may be different from men's symptoms.  Women are more likely than men to have certain types of heart disease that can be harder to diagnose.    A delay in diagnosis may mean a delay in medical care that could help prevent serious problems, such as a heart attack. That's why it's important to learn about your risk for heart disease, the symptoms in women, and how to keep your heart healthy.  What types of heart disease do women get? Women can get any type of heart disease. Like men, the most common type of heart disease among women is coronary artery disease. But there are certain types of heart disease which are less common, but affect women more often than men:  Coronary microvascular disease - Chest pain from spasms (sudden tightening) in the smallest arteries of the heart that pinch off blood flow. It typically happens during rest or routine activities. This serious condition increases your risk of having a heart attack or other heart diseases.  This type may be harder to diagnose since blockages in smaller arteries can be harder to see on imaging tests. Broken heart syndrome - Strong chest pain or other signs that look like a heart attack. It's caused by the stress of powerful emotions, such as deep grief, anger, or surprise. It can happen even if you're healthy. It mostly affects women after menopause and usually doesn't cause any lasting damage. Variant angina - A rare type of strong chest pain from spasms in the heart arteries. The pain usually happens in a pattern during sleep. Variant angina rarely causes a heart attack.    Which women are more likely to develop heart disease? Your risk for developing heart disease increases with:  Menopause. Women can develop heart disease at any age, but your risk increases after your periods stop, usually by age 55. Before menopause, your body makes more estrogen (a female hormone) which helps protect against heart disease. That's why women generally develop coronary artery disease 10 years later than men. During and after menopause, estrogen levels drop and your risk for heart diseases goes up. If your periods stop before age 40, your risk will be higher than other women your age. Family history of heart disease. Your risk for heart disease may be higher if your: \t \t\tMother or sister had heart disease before age 65. \t\tFather or brother had heart disease before age 55. \t  Problems during pregnancy, such as  high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, anemia, and high blood pressure. Use of hormonal birth control (pills, patches, or vaginal rings with estrogen and progesterone). Endometriosis. Polycystic ovary syndrome. Inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Metabolic syndrome. Mental health issues, such as stress, anxiety, or depression. Health risks from a lack physical activity. Obesity or being overweight.   Diabetes. Low HDL cholesterol levels. Mild to moderate high blood pressure. Smoking.   If you have one or more risks for heart disease, ask your health care provider for help understanding your risk level. Ask if you need any heart tests to help catch heart disease early.   What are the symptoms of heart disease and heart attack in women? When women have symptoms of heart disease, they may include:  Pain or discomfort in the chest that may be dull and heavy or sharp Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper belly, or back Nausea or vomiting  Unusual fatigue Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air) during physical activity   Women who have coronary artery disease are more likely than men to have chest pain when resting or doing daily activities, rather than during exercise. They're also more likely than men to feel chest pain from mental stress.  Symptoms of a heart attack in women may also be different than in men. Chest pain is the most common symptom for both sexes. It may feel like crushing or squeezing. But women are somewhat less likely than men to have chest pain.   During a heart attack, women may feel:  Pressure or tightness in the chest Pain in the upper back, arms, neck, jaw or throat Dizziness Unusual fatigue Indigestion, heartburn, nausea, or vomiting  Stomach pain Shortness of breath   Heart attacks usually don't look like the sudden, dramatic events we see in the movies. The symptoms may be mild or strong. They may start slowly. They can stop and then come back.  Can heart disease in women be prevented?  You can help lower your risk by:  Learning how to prevent heart disease and making heart-healthy habits part of your daily life.  Asking your provider about your personal risk for heart disease and the best way to manage your heart health.    Remember, women can have heart disease without symptoms. But if you pay attention to your risk for heart disease, you can take action to prevent problems or keep them from getting worse.  NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "summary": "What is heart disease?  Heart disease is a general term that includes many types of heart problems. It's a type of cardiovascular disease, which means heart and blood vessel disease.  Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, but there are ways to prevent and manage many types of heart disease.  What are the types of heart disease? There are many different types of heart disease. Some you may be born with, called congenital heart disease. Other types develop during your lifetime.  Coronary artery disease (also called coronary heart disease) is the most common type of heart disease. It happens slowly over time when a sticky substance called plaque builds up in the arteries that supply your heart muscle with blood. The plaque narrows or blocks blood flow to the heart muscle and can lead to other heart problems:  Angina - chest pain from lack of blood flow Heart attacks - when part of the heart muscle dies from loss of blood flow Heart failure - when your heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs Arrhythmia - a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat   Other types of heart diseases may affect your heart valves or heart muscle (cardiomyopathy).  What causes heart diseases? The causes of heart disease depend on the type of disease. Some possible causes include lifestyle, genetics, infections, medicines, and other diseases.  Who is more likely to develop heart diseases? There are many different factors that can make you more likely to develop heart disease. Some of these factors you can change, but others you cannot.   Age. Your risk of heart disease goes up as you get older. Sex. Some factors may affect heart disease risk differently in women than in men.  Family history and genetics. A family history of early heart disease raises your risk. And research has shown that some genes are linked to a higher risk of certain heart diseases.  Race/ethnicity. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in most racial and ethnic groups in the United States. However, certain groups have higher risks than others. This includes Black people, White people, and American Indian/Alaska Native people.   Lifestyle habits. Over time, unhealthy lifestyle habits can raise your risk of heart disease. These can include:  \t \t\tEating a diet high in saturated fats, refined carbohydrates, and salt. \t\tNot getting enough physical activity. \t\tDrinking too much alcohol. \t\tSmoking and exposure to secondhand smoke. \t\tToo much stress. \t  Having other medical conditions can raise your risk of heart diseases. These conditions include: \t \t\tHigh blood pressure. \t\tHigh cholesterol levels. \t\tDiabetes. \t\tObesity. \t\tAutoimmune and inflammatory diseases. \t\tChronic kidney disease. \t\tMetabolic syndrome. \t    What are the symptoms of heart disease? Your symptoms will depend on the type of heart disease you have. You may not have symptoms at first. In some cases, you may not know you have heart disease until you have a complication such as a heart attack.  How are heart diseases diagnosed? To find out if you have heart disease, your health care provider will:  Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms Ask about your family health history, including relatives who have had heart disease Do a physical exam Likely run heart tests and blood tests   In some cases, your provider may refer you to a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) for tests, diagnosis, and care.  What are the treatments for heart disease? Treatment plans for heart disease depend on the type of heart disease you have, how serious your symptoms are, and what other health conditions you have.

    "disease": "Heart Failure",
    "summary": "What is heart failure? Heart failure means that your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your body's needs. Heart failure doesn't mean that your heart has stopped or is about to stop beating. But without enough blood flow, your organs may not work well, which can cause serious problems.    Heart failure can affect one or both sides of your heart:  With right-sided heart failure, your heart is too weak to pump enough blood to your lungs to get oxygen. With left-sided heart failure, your heart can't pump enough oxygen-rich blood out to your body. This happens when the left side of your heart becomes either: \t \t\tToo weak to pump enough blood. \t\tToo thick or stiff to relax and fill with enough blood. \t    Left-sided heart failure is more common than right-sided heart failure.  What causes heart failure? Heart failure can start suddenly after a medical condition or injury damages your heart muscle. But in most cases, heart failure develops slowly from long-term medical conditions.   Conditions that can cause heart failure include:  Arrhythmia (a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat) Cardiomyopathy Congenital heart defects or other types of heart diseases that you are born with Coronary artery disease Endocarditis Heart attack Heart valve diseases High blood pressure A blood clot in your lung Diabetes Certain severe lung diseases, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Obesity   Over time, left-sided heart failure can lead to right-sided heart failure.  Who is more likely to develop heart failure? Heart failure can happen at any age. It happens to both men and women, but men often develop it at a younger age than women.  Your chance of developing heart failure increases if:  You're 65 years old or older. Aging can weaken and stiffen your heart muscle. Your family health history includes relatives who have or have had heart failure.  You have changes in your genes that affect your heart tissue. You have habits that can harm your heart, including: \t \t\tSmoking \t\tEating foods high in fat, cholesterol, and sodium (salt)  \t\tHaving an inactive lifestyle \t\tAlcohol use disorder (AUD) \t\tIllegal drug use \t  You have other medical conditions that can affect your heart, including:  \t \t\tAny heart or blood vessel conditions, including high blood pressure \t\tSerious lung diseases \t\tInfection, such as HIV or COVID-19 \t\tObesity \t\tDiabetes \t\tSleep apnea \t\tChronic kidney disease \t\tAnemia \t\tThyroid disease \t\tIron overload disease \t\tCancer treatments that can harm your heart, such as radiation and chemotherapy \t  You are African American. African Americans are more likely to develop heart failure and have more serious cases at younger ages than people of other races. Factors such as stigma, discrimination, income, education, and geographic region can also affect their risk of heart failure.   What are the symptoms of heart failure? The symptoms of heart failure depend on which side of your heart is affected and how serious your condition has become.  Most symptoms are caused by reduced blood flow to your organs and fluid buildup in your body.  Fluid buildup happens because the flow of blood through your heart is too slow. As a result, blood backs up in the vessels that return the blood to your heart. Fluid may leak from the blood vessels and collect in the tissues of your body, causing swelling (edema) and other problems.    Symptoms of heart failure may include:  Feeling short of breath (like you can't get enough air) when you do things like climbing stairs. This may be one of the first symptoms you notice.  Fatigue or weakness even after rest. Coughing. Swelling and weight gain from fluid in your ankles, lower legs, or abdomen (belly). Difficulty sleeping when lying flat. Nausea and loss of appetite. Swelling in the veins of your neck. Needing to urinate (pee) often.   At first you may have no symptoms or mild symptoms. As the disease gets worse, your symptoms will usually bother you more.    What other problems does heart failure cause? Fluid buildup and reduced blood flow to your organs can lead to serious problems, including:  Breathing problems from fluid in and around your lungs (also called congestive heart failure)  Kidney or liver damage, including cirrhosis Malnutrition if fluid buildup makes eating uncomfortable or if your stomach doesn't get enough blood flow to digest food properly Other heart conditions, such as irregular heartbeat and sudden cardiac arrest Pulmonary hypertension   How is heart failure diagnosed? To find out if you have heart failure, your health care provider will   Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms Ask about your family health history, including relatives who have had heart failure Do a physical exam Likely run heart tests and blood tests, including a brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) test   In some cases, your provider may refer you to a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases) for tests, diagnosis, and care.    What are the treatments for heart failure? Your treatment will depend on the type of heart failure you have and how serious it is. There's no cure for heart failure. But treatment can help you live longer with fewer symptoms.  Even with treatment, heart failure usually gets worse over time, so you'll likely need treatment for the rest of your life.   Most treatment plans include:  Taking medicine Eating less sodium and drinking less liquid to control fluid buildup Making other changes, such as quitting smoking, managing stress, and getting as much physical activity as your provider recommends Treating any conditions that may make heart failure worse   You may need heart surgery if:   You have a congenital heart defect or damage to your heart that can be fixed. The left side of your heart is getting weaker and putting a device in your chest could help. Devices include: \t \t\tAn implantable cardioverter defibrillator. \t\tA biventricular pacemaker (cardiac resynchronization therapy). \t\tA mechanical heart pump (a ventricular assist device (VAD) or a total artificial heart). \t  Your heart doctor recommends a heart transplant because your heart failure is life-threatening and nothing else is helping.   As part of your treatment, you'll need to pay close attention to your symptoms, because heart failure can worsen suddenly. Your provider may suggest a cardiac rehabilitation program to help you learn how to manage your condition.   Can heart failure be prevented? You may be able to prevent or delay heart failure if you:  Work with your provider to manage any health conditions that increase your risk of developing heart failure Make healthy changes in your eating, exercise, and other daily habits to help prevent heart disease   NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "summary": "Heart diseases are the number one killer in the United States. They are also a major cause of disability. If you do have heart disease, it is important to find it early, when it is easier to treat. Blood tests and heart health tests can help find heart diseases or identify problems that can lead to heart diseases. There are several different types of heart health tests. Your health care provider will decide which test or tests you need, based on your symptoms (if any), risk factors, and medical history.  Cardiac Catheterization Cardiac catheterization is a medical procedure used to diagnose and treat some heart conditions. For the procedure, your provider puts a catheter (a long, thin, flexible tube) into a blood vessel in your arm, groin, or neck, and threads it to your heart. The provider can use the catheter to: Do a coronary angiography. This involves putting a special type of dye in the catheter, so the dye can flow through your bloodstream to your heart. Then your provider takes x-rays of your heart. The dye allows your provider to see your coronary arteries on the x-ray, and to check for coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is caused by plaque buildup in the arteries.  Take samples of your blood and heart muscle. Examine your heart valves. Do procedures such as angioplasty or minor heart surgeries to repair congenital heart defects or replace heart valves.   Cardiac CT Scan A cardiac CT (computed tomography) scan is a painless imaging test that uses x-rays to take detailed pictures of your heart and its blood vessels. Computers can combine these pictures to create a three-dimensional (3D) model of your whole heart. This test can help providers detect or evaluate various heart problems, including:  Coronary artery disease Calcium buildup in the coronary arteries Congenital heart defects Problems with the aorta (the main artery that carries blood away from the heart) Problems with heart function and valves Pericardial diseases   Before you have the test, you get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures. The CT scanner is a large, tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table that slides you into the scanner, and the scanner takes the pictures.  Cardiac MRI Cardiac MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is a painless imaging test that uses radio waves, magnets, and a computer to create detailed pictures of your heart. It can help your provider figure out whether you have heart disease, and if so, how severe it is. A cardiac MRI can also help your provider decide the best way to treat heart problems such as:   Congenital heart defects Coronary artery disease Heart valve problems  Pericarditis Cardiac tumors Damage from a heart attack   The MRI is a large, tunnel-like machine. You lie still on a table that slides you into the MRI machine. The machine makes loud noises as it takes pictures of your heart. Sometimes before the test, you might get an injection of contrast dye. The dye highlights your heart and blood vessels in the pictures.  Chest X-Ray A chest x-ray creates pictures of the organs and structures inside your chest, such as your heart, lungs, and blood vessels. It can reveal signs of heart failure, as well as lung disorders and other causes of symptoms not related to heart disease.  Coronary Angiography Coronary angiography (angiogram) is a procedure that uses contrast dye and x-ray pictures to look at the insides of your arteries. It can show whether plaque is blocking your arteries and how severe the blockage is. Providers use this procedure to diagnose heart diseases after chest pain, sudden cardiac arrest (SCA), or abnormal results from other heart tests such as an EKG or a stress test.   You usually have a cardiac catheterization to inject the dye into your coronary arteries. Then the provider will take special x-rays while the dye is flowing through your coronary arteries. The dye lets your provider study the flow of blood through your heart and blood vessels.   Echocardiography  Echocardiography, or echo, is a painless test that uses sound waves to create moving pictures of your heart. The pictures show the size and shape of your heart. They also show how well your heart's chambers and valves are working. Providers use an echo to diagnose many different heart problems, and to check how severe they are.   There are several different types of echocardiography. For transthoracic echocardiography (the most common type), a technician applies gel to your chest. The gel helps sound waves reach your heart. The technician moves a transducer (wand-like device) across your chest. The transducer connects to a computer. It transmits ultrasound waves into your chest, and the waves bounce (echo) back. The computer converts the echoes into pictures of your heart.   Electrocardiogram (EKG), (ECG) An electrocardiogram, also called an ECG or EKG, is a painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity. It shows how fast your heart is beating and whether its rhythm is steady or irregular.  An EKG may be part of a routine exam to screen for heart disease. Or you may get it to detect and study heart problems such as heart attacks, arrhythmia, and heart failure.   For the test, you lie still on a table and a nurse or technician attaches electrodes (patches that have sensors) to the skin on your chest, arms, and legs. Wires connect the electrodes to a machine that records your heart's electrical activity.   Stress Testing Stress testing looks at how your heart works during physical stress. It can help to diagnose coronary artery disease, and to check how severe it is. It can also check for other problems, including heart valve disease and heart failure.  For the test, you exercise (or are given medicine if you are unable to exercise) to make your heart work hard and beat fast. While this is happening, you get an EKG and blood pressure monitoring. Before or after the test, you might also have an echocardiogram, or other imaging tests such as a nuclear scan. For the nuclear scan, you get an injection of a tracer (a radioactive substance), which travels to your heart. Special cameras detect the energy from the tracer to craeate pictures of your heart. You have pictures taken after you exercise, and then after you rest.   NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "summary": "What is heart surgery? Heart surgery can correct certain heart problems when other treatments haven't worked or can't be used.  In some cases, heart surgery may be a medical emergency. For example, surgery for a severe heart attack may need to be done right away. In other cases, you can plan heart surgery ahead of time. Some heart surgeries are major operations, such as heart bypass surgery for blocked arteries in the heart. Other surgeries are more minor heart procedures, such as putting in a pacemaker.    What conditions does heart surgery treat? There are different types of heart surgery that can help treat many heart conditions:                             What conditions does heart surgery treat?             What does the heart surgery do?                                         Coronary artery disease (CAD) - when a sticky substance called plaque narrows or blocks the arteries that supply blood to your heart muscle.             Makes a new path for blood to flow around the blocked part of an artery in the heart. This is called a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG), or heart bypass. It's the most common heart surgery in adults.                                      Heart valve diseases - problems with the valves that control the flow of blood through your heart.             Repairs heart valves.Replaces heart valves with a mechanical valve or a biologic valve made from pig, cow, or human heart tissue.                                      Arrhythmia - problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat. They are caused by changes in the electrical signals that control your heartbeat.             Places a pacemaker or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) in the chest to correct your heartbeat.Treats atrial fibrillation with small cuts in the heart muscle. The cuts form scars that make a path for the heart's electrical signals (Maze surgery).                                      Heart failure - when your heart is too weak or stiff to pump enough oxygen-rich blood to meet your body's needs.             Places a device in the chest which may include:An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to help prevent sudden cardiac arrest.A biventricular pacemaker to coordinate the heart's pumping action so it's more powerful.A ventricular assist device to help the heart pump blood.A total artificial heart to pump blood for the heart.Replaces a seriously diseased heart with a heathy heart (heart transplantation).                                       Heart aneurysm - a balloon-like bulge in the wall of an artery. It can be life-threatening if the aneurysm tears or bursts.             Repairs or replaces the weak part of a heart artery using a patch or a tube made of fabric.                        \t             Angina - chest pain from coronary artery disease.             Uses a laser to make small channels through part of the heart muscle (transmyocardial laser revascularization).                                     Damaged and abnormal heart structures, including congenital heart defects - heart structure problems that you're born with.             Repairs heart damage or problems with how the heart and blood vessels are formed. Repairs depend on the type of defect or damage.                         What approaches do surgeons use to do heart surgery? The approach a surgeon uses to do heart surgery depends on your heart problem, your general health, and other factors. Approaches to heart surgery include:   Open-heart surgery (also called traditional heart surgery) is when the surgeon cuts the chest open to reach the heart. Because it's difficult to operate on a beating heart, medicines are used to stop the heart. A heart-lung bypass machine keeps oxygen-rich blood pumping through the body during the surgery. Off-pump heart surgery is open-heart surgery on a beating heart without using a heart-lung bypass machine. The surgeon holds the heart steady with a device. Surgeons may use off-pump heart surgery to do coronary artery bypass grafts (CABG), but only in certain cases.  Minimally invasive heart surgery uses small cuts between the ribs. The cuts may be as small as 2 to 3 inches. The surgeon inserts tools into the chest through the cuts. This type of heart surgery may or may not use a heart-lung bypass machine. Robotic-assisted surgery is a type of minimally invasive surgery. The surgeon uses a computer to control tools on the arms of a robot. This allows the surgeon to be very accurate when doing difficult operations.   What are the risks of heart surgery? Like all surgery, heart surgery has risks even though the results are often excellent. The risks include:  Bleeding Infection, fever, and swelling A problem from anesthesia (medicine that makes you sleep during surgery) Arrhythmia Damage to the heart, kidneys, liver, and lungs Stroke  The risks of heart surgery tend to be higher if:  The surgery is an emergency. You have other medical conditions, including: \t \t\tDiabetes  \t\tKidney diseases   \t\tLung diseases   \t\tPeripheral artery disease (PAD)  \t    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "disease": "Heart Valve Diseases",
    "summary": "What are heart valve diseases? Heart valve disease happens when one or more of your heart valves don't work well.  Your heart has four valves: the tricuspid, pulmonary, mitral, and aortic valves. The valves have flaps that open and close. The flaps make sure that blood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats they close to stop the blood from flowing backwards.  If one or more of your heart valves doesn't open or close correctly, it can affect your blood flow and strain your heart. Fortunately, treatment helps most valve diseases.   What are the types of heart valve diseases? Heart valves can have three basic kinds of problems:   Regurgitation, or backflow, happens when the flaps of a valve don't close tightly. This allows the blood to leak backwards. A common cause of regurgitation is prolapse, where the flaps of the valve flop or bulge back. Prolapse most often affects the mitral valve.  Stenosis happens when the flaps of a valve become thick, stiff, or stuck together. This prevents the heart valve from opening all the way. Not enough blood can pass through the valve. Aortic valve stenosis is a common type of stenosis. It affects the valve that controls blood flow into the large artery that carries blood out of the heart to the body.  Atresia happens when a heart valve did not form properly and does not have an opening for blood to pass through.  Sometimes a valve can have both regurgitation and stenosis.   What causes heart valve diseases? Some people are born with heart valve disease. This is called congenital heart valve disease. It can happen alone or along with other congenital heart defects. Heart valve disease can also develop over time as you get older or have certain conditions that affect the heart.   Who is more likely to develop heart valve diseases? Your chance of having heart valve disease is higher if:  You are older. With age, the heart valves can become thick and stiff. You have or have had other conditions that affect your heart and blood vessels. These include: \t \t\tRheumatic fever. An untreated strep throat can become rheumatic fever, which can harm the heart valves. The damage may not show up for years. Today, most people take antibiotics to cure strep throat before it can cause heart valve damage.  \t\tEndocarditis. This is a rare infection in the lining of the heart and heart valves. It is usually caused by bacteria in the bloodstream.   \t\tA heart attack.  \t\tHeart failure. \t\tCoronary artery disease, especially when it affects the aorta (the large artery that carries blood from the heart to the body). \t\tHigh blood pressure.  \t\tHigh blood cholesterol.  \t\tDiabetes. \t\tObesity and overweight. \t\tLack of physical activity. \t  A family history of early heart disease:  \t \t\tA father or brother who had heart disease younger than 55. \t\tA mother or sister who had heart disease younger than 65.  \t  You were born with an aortic valve that wasn't formed right. Sometimes this will cause problems right away. Other times, the valve may work well enough for years before causing problems.   What are the symptoms of heart valve diseases? Many people live their whole lives with a heart valve that doesn't work perfectly and never have any problems. But heart valve disease may get worse slowly over time. You may develop signs and symptoms, such as:  Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air) Fatigue Swelling in your feet, ankles, abdomen (belly), or the veins in your neck Chest pain when you're physically active Arrhythmia, a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat Dizziness or fainting  If you don't get treatment for heart valve disease, the symptoms and strain on your heart may keep getting worse.  What other problems can heart valve diseases cause? When the valves don't work well, your heart has to pump harder to get enough blood out to the body.  Without treatment, this extra workload on your heart can lead to:  Heart failure Stroke Blood clots Sudden cardiac arrest or death   How is heart valve disease diagnosed? Your health care provider may listen to your heart with a stethoscope and hear that your heart makes abnormal sounds, such as a click or a heart murmur. These sounds may mean a valve isn't working normally. The provider will usually refer you to a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart diseases. The doctor will also listen to your heart and will do a physical exam. You will also likely need to have one or more heart tests.   What are the treatments for heart valve diseases? Most heart valve problems can be treated successfully. Treatment may include:  Medicines to control your symptoms and keep your heart pumping well  Heart-healthy lifestyle changes to treat other related heart conditions Surgery to repair or replace a valve  It's possible that you may need surgery, even if you don't have symptoms. Fixing the valve can help prevent future heart problems.  There are many ways to do heart valve surgery. You and your doctor can decide what's best for you, based on your valve problem and general health. Heart valve repair surgery has fewer risks than heart valve replacement. So, when repair is possible, it's preferred over valve replacement.   In some cases, valve replacement is necessary. There are 2 types of replacement valves:  Biologic valves made from pig, cow, or human tissue. These valves tend to wear out after 10 to 15 years, but some may last longer.  Mechanical (human-made) valves usually don't wear out. But with a mechanical valve, you usually have to take blood thinners for the rest of your life to prevent blood clots. And your risk of endocarditis (a heart infection) is higher than with a biologic valve.   NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

About 30 to 40% of people in the United States get an H. pylori infection. Most people get it as a child. H. pylori usually does not cause symptoms. But it can break down the inner protective coating in some people's stomachs and cause inflammation. This can lead to gastritis or a peptic ulcer.   Researchers aren't sure how H. pylori spreads. They think that it may spread by unclean food and water, or through contact with an infected person's saliva and other body fluids.  A peptic ulcer causes a dull or burning pain in your stomach, especially when you have an empty stomach. It lasts for minutes to hours, and it may come and go for several days or weeks.  It may also cause other symptoms, such as bloating, nausea, and weight loss. If you have the symptoms of a peptic ulcer, your health care provider will check to see whether you have H. pylori.  There are blood, breath, and stool tests to check for H. pylori. In some cases, you may need an upper endoscopy, often with a biopsy.  If you do have a peptic ulcer, the treatment is with a combination of antibiotics and acid-reducing medicines. You will need to be tested again after treatment to make sure the infection is gone.  There is no vaccine for H. pylori.

    "disease": "Hemophilia",
    "summary": "What is hemophilia?  Hemophilia is a rare bleeding disorder in which the blood does not clot properly. This can lead to problems with bleeding too much after an injury or surgery. You can also have sudden bleeding inside your body, such as in your joints, muscles, and organs.  Your blood contains many proteins called clotting factors that can help form clots to stop bleeding. People with hemophilia have low levels of one of these factors, usually either factor VIII (8) or factor IX (9). How severe the hemophilia is depends on the amount of factor in the blood. The lower the amount of the factor, the more likely it is that bleeding could happen and might lead to serious health problems.  What are the types of hemophilia? There are several different types of hemophilia. The most common are:  Hemophilia A (classic hemophilia), which is caused by a lack or decrease of clotting factor VIII (8) Hemophilia B (Christmas disease), which is caused by a lack or decrease of clotting factor IX (9)   What causes hemophilia? Most types of hemophilia are inherited. They are caused by change in one of the genes (also called a mutation) that provides instructions for making the clotting factor proteins. The change may mean that the clotting proteins don't work properly or that they are missing altogether. These genes are on the X chromosome. You may have one or two X chromosomes:  People who are born male have one X chromosome (from the mother) and one Y chromosome (from the father). They can get hemophilia if their one X chromosome has the gene change.  People who are born female have two X chromosomes, one from the father and one from the mother. They usually only get hemophilia if: \t \t\tBoth X chromosomes have the gene change OR \t\tOne X chromosome has the gene change and the other X chromosome is missing or inactive. \t   People who are born female who have the gene change on one X chromosome are a \"carrier\" of hemophilia. Sometimes they may have some symptoms of hemophilia. They can pass the gene change on to their children.     Hemophilia that is not inherited is called acquired hemophilia. It is rare. It happens when your body makes specialized proteins called autoantibodies that attack and disable a clotting factor. This can happen because of pregnancy, immune system disorders, cancer, or allergic reactions to certain medicines. Sometimes the cause is unknown.  Who is at risk for hemophilia? Hemophilia is much more common in people who were born male since they can get it with a change to the gene on one X chromosome. People who have a family history of hemophilia are also at higher risk.  What are the symptoms of hemophilia? The signs and symptoms of hemophilia are:  Bleeding into the joints. This can cause swelling and pain or tightness in the joints. It often affects the knees, elbows, and ankles. Bleeding into the skin (which is bruising).  Bleeding into the muscle and soft tissue, which can cause a build-up of blood in the area (called a hematoma). Bleeding of the mouth and gums, including bleeding that is hard to stop after you lose a tooth. Bleeding after circumcision. Bleeding after having shots, such as vaccinations. Bleeding in the head of an infant after a difficult delivery. Blood in the urine or stool. Frequent and hard-to-stop nosebleeds.  In some cases, severe hemophilia may cause bleeding in the brain. This may cause brain damage and can be life-threatening.  How is hemophilia diagnosed? To find out if you have hemophilia, your health care provider will:  Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms and other health conditions you may have. Ask about your family history, to find out if you have relatives who have or had hemophilia. Do a physical exam to look for signs of hemophilia, such as bruising. Do certain blood tests to show if your blood is clotting properly. If it does not, then you will have clotting factor tests to diagnose the cause of the bleeding disorder. These blood tests would show the type of hemophilia and the severity.  There is genetic testing for the factor VIII (8) and factor IX (9) genes. This testing may be used in people who have a family history of hemophilia to:  Identify people who are carriers before they make decisions about pregnancy Test a fetus for hemophilia during pregnancy Test a newborn for hemophilia   What are the treatments for hemophilia? The best way to treat hemophilia is to replace the missing clotting factor so that your blood can clot properly. This is usually done by injecting replacement clotting factor into a vein. The replacement clotting factor may be made from donated human blood. Or it may be made in a lab; this kind is called a recombinant clotting factor. Replacement clotting factor can help treat a bleeding episode. In more severe cases of hemophilia, you might get the factor on a regular basis to prevent bleeding. You can learn how to inject the factor so that you can do it yourself at home. There are other medicines to treat hemophilia. They may work by releasing factor VIII (8) from where it is stored in the body tissues, replacing the function of factor VIII (8), or preventing clots from breaking down.  If bleeding has damaged your joints, physical therapy may help them function better.  Good quality medical care from healthcare professionals who know a lot about the disorder can help prevent some serious problems. Often the best choice for care is to visit a hemophilia treatment center (HTC). Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

    "summary": "What is a hemorrhagic stroke? A stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.   There are two main types of strokes, ischemic and hemorrhagic. A hemorrhagic stroke is less common but often more severe. It occurs when a blood vessel in the brain bursts, causing bleeding (hemorrhage) in or around the brain. This bleeding increases pressure inside the skull and damages brain tissue. Within minutes, brain cells begin to die.   What are the types of hemorrhagic stroke? Hemorrhagic strokes are classified by where the bleeding happens:  Intracerebral hemorrhage. Bleeding occurs directly into the brain tissue. This is the most common type of hemorrhagic stroke. Subarachnoid hemorrhage. Bleeding occurs in the space between the brain and the thin layers of tissues covering it. This often happens when a weak spot in an artery (called an aneurysm) bursts on the brain's surface.    What causes hemorrhagic stroke? Common causes include:  Aneurysm. A bulge or \"ballooning\" in a weakened artery wall that can burst. Arteriovenous malformation (AVM). A tangled group of abnormal blood vessels that can rupture inside the brain. High blood pressure (hypertension). Over time, it can weaken blood vessel walls and increase the risk of them breaking open. Head trauma. Brain injury can cause bleeding.   What are the symptoms of a hemorrhagic stroke? Stroke symptoms often happen suddenly. They include:   Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body) Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or understanding speech Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination Sudden severe headache with no known cause   The F.A.S.T. test can help you remember what to look for if you think someone is having a  stroke. Think \"FAST\" and look for:  Face drooping on one side when smiling. Arm weakness occurs when the arms are raised, and one arm drifts downward. Speech is slurred or strange. Time to call 911.    How is a hemorrhagic stroke diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider may do a physical exam, ask about your symptoms and medical history, and use imaging tests to check for bleeding in your brain.   How is hemorrhagic stroke treated? It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. For a hemorrhagic stroke, the first step is to find the cause of bleeding in the brain and stop it. Treatment may involve medicines or, in some cases, surgery to stop the bleeding or relieve pressure on the brain.  After the stroke, rehabilitation can help people recover lost abilities and regain independence.  Can a hemorrhagic stroke be prevented? The best way to prevent stroke is by making heart-healthy lifestyle changes to lower your risk. If lifestyle changes aren't enough, your provider may prescribe medicine to help manage your risk factors.  NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",

There are two types: External hemorrhoids, which form under the skin around your anus Internal hemorrhoids, which form in the lining of your anus and lower rectum   What causes hemorrhoids? Hemorrhoids happen when there is too much pressure on the veins around the anus. This can be caused by: Straining during bowel movements. Sitting on the toilet for long periods of time. Chronic constipation or diarrhea. A low-fiber diet. Weakening of the supporting tissues in your anus and rectum. This can happen with aging and pregnancy. Frequently lifting heavy objects.   What are the symptoms of hemorrhoids? The symptoms of hemorrhoids depend on which type you have: With external hemorrhoids, you may have: Anal itching One or more hard, tender lumps near your anus Anal pain, especially when sitting  Too much straining, rubbing, or cleaning around your anus may make your symptoms worse. For many people, the symptoms of external hemorrhoids go away within a few days. With internal hemorrhoids, you may have: Bleeding from your rectum - you would see bright red blood in your stool, on toilet paper, or in the toilet bowl after a bowel movement Prolapse, which is a hemorrhoid that has fallen through your anal opening  Internal hemorrhoids are usually not painful unless they are prolapsed. Prolapsed internal hemorrhoids may cause pain and discomfort.   How can I treat hemorrhoids at home? You can most often treat your hemorrhoids at home by: Eating foods that are high in fiber. Taking a stool softener or a fiber supplement. Drinking enough fluids every day. Not straining during bowel movements. Not sitting on the toilet for long periods of time. Taking over-the-counter pain relievers. Taking warm baths several times a day to help relieve pain. This could be a regular bath or a sitz bath. With a sitz bath, you use a special plastic tub that allows you to sit in a few inches of warm water. Using over-the-counter hemorrhoid creams, ointments, or suppositories to relieve mild pain, swelling, and itching of external hemorrhoids.   When do I need to see a health care provider for hemorrhoids?  You should see your health care provider if you: Still have symptoms after 1 week of at-home treatment. Have bleeding from your rectum. Hemorrhoids are a common cause of bleeding, but other conditions can also cause bleeding. They include Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, colorectal cancer, and anal cancer. So it's important to see your provider to find the cause of the bleeding.   How are hemorrhoids diagnosed? To find out if you have hemorrhoids, your health care provider:  Will ask about your medical history. Will do a physical exam. Often providers can diagnose external hemorrhoids by looking at the area around your anus.  Will do a digital rectal exam to check for internal hemorrhoids. For this, the provider will insert a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for anything that is abnormal. May do procedures such as an anoscopy to check for internal hemorrhoids.   What are the treatments for hemorrhoids? If at-home treatments for hemorrhoids don't help you, you may need a medical procedure. There are several different procedures that your provider can do in the office. These procedures use different techniques to cause scar tissue to form in the hemorrhoids. This cuts off the blood supply, which usually shrinks the hemorrhoids. In severe cases, you may need surgery.  Can hemorrhoids be prevented? You can help prevent hemorrhoids by: Eating foods that are high in fiber Taking a stool softener or a fiber supplement Drinking enough fluids every day Not straining during bowel movements Not sitting on the toilet for long periods of time   NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

This swelling and damage can affect how well your liver functions. Hepatitis can be an acute (short-term) infection or a chronic (long-term) infection. Some types of hepatitis cause only acute infections. Other types can cause both acute and chronic infections.   What causes hepatitis? There are different types of hepatitis, with different causes: Viral hepatitis is the most common type. It is caused by one of several viruses -- hepatitis viruses A, B, C, D, and E. In the United States, A, B, and C are the most common. Alcoholic hepatitis is caused by heavy alcohol use Toxic hepatitis can be caused by certain poisons, chemicals, medicines, or supplements Autoimmune hepatitis is a chronic type in which your body's immune system attacks your liver. The cause is not known, but genetics and your environment may play a role.   How is viral hepatitis spread? Hepatitis A and hepatitis E usually spread through contact with food or water that was contaminated with an infected person's stool. You can also get hepatitis E by eating undercooked pork, deer, or shellfish. Hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and hepatitis D spread through contact with the blood of someone who has the disease. Hepatitis B and D may also spread through contact with other body fluids. This can happen in many ways, such as sharing drug needles or having unprotected sex.  Who is at risk for hepatitis? The risks are different for the different types of hepatitis. For example, with most of the viral types, your risk is higher if you have unprotected sex.  People who drink a lot over long periods of time are at risk for alcoholic hepatitis.  What are the symptoms of hepatitis? Some people with hepatitis do not have symptoms and do not know they are infected. If you do have symptoms, they may include: Fever Fatigue Loss of appetite Nausea and/or vomiting Abdominal pain Dark urine Clay-colored bowel movements Joint pain Jaundice, yellowing of your skin and eyes  If you have an acute infection, your symptoms can start anywhere between 2 weeks to 6 months after you got infected. If you have a chronic infection, you may not have symptoms until many years later.  What other problems can hepatitis cause? Chronic hepatitis can lead to complications such as cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver failure, and liver cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment of chronic hepatitis may prevent these complications.  How is hepatitis diagnosed? To diagnose hepatitis, your health care provider: Will ask about your symptoms and medical history Will do a physical exam Will likely do blood tests, including tests for viral hepatitis Might do imaging tests, such as an ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI May need to do a liver biopsy to get a clear diagnosis and check for liver damage   What are the treatments for hepatitis? Treatment for hepatitis depends on which type you have and whether it is acute or chronic. Acute viral hepatitis often goes away on its own. To feel better, you may just need to rest and get enough fluids. But in some cases, it may be more serious. You might even need treatment in a hospital. There are different medicines to treat the different chronic types of hepatitis. Possible other treatments may include surgery and other medical procedures. People who have alcoholic hepatitis need to stop drinking. If your chronic hepatitis leads to liver failure or liver cancer, you may need a liver transplant.  Can hepatitis be prevented? There are different ways to prevent or lower your risk for hepatitis, depending on the type of hepatitis. For example, not drinking too much alcohol can prevent alcoholic hepatitis.

If you have acute hepatitis B, you probably don't need treatment. Some people with chronic hepatitis B don't need treatment. But if you have a chronic infection and blood tests show that hepatitis B could be damaging your liver, you may need to take antiviral medicines.  Can hepatitis B be prevented? The best way to prevent hepatitis B is to get the hepatitis B vaccine. You can also reduce your chance of hepatitis B infection by: Not sharing drug needles or other drug materials Wearing gloves if you have to touch another person's blood or open sores Making sure your tattoo artist or body piercer uses sterile tools Not sharing personal items, such as toothbrushes, razors, or nail clippers Using a latex condom during sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.   If you think you have been in contact with the hepatitis B virus, see your health care provider right away. Your provider may give you a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine to prevent infection. In some cases, your provider may also give you a medicine called hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG). You need to get the vaccine and the HBIG (if needed) as soon as possible after coming into contact with the virus. It is best if you can get them within 24 hours.

    "disease": "Hepatitis C",
    "summary": "What is hepatitis C? Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. Inflammation is swelling that happens when tissues of the body are injured or infected. Inflammation can damage organs. There are different types of hepatitis. One type, hepatitis C, is caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV). Hepatitis C can range from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Hepatitis C can be acute or chronic: Acute hepatitis C is a short-term infection. The symptoms can last up to 6 months. Sometimes your body is able to fight off the infection and the virus goes away. But for most people, an acute infection leads to chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis C is a long-lasting infection. If it is not treated, it can last for a lifetime and cause serious health problems, including liver damage, cirrhosis (scarring of the liver), liver cancer, and even death.   How is hepatitis C spread? Hepatitis C spreads through contact with the blood of someone who has HCV. This contact may be through: Sharing drug needles or other drug materials with someone who has HCV. In the United States, this is the most common way that people get hepatitis C. Getting an accidental stick with a needle that was used on someone who has HCV. This can happen in health care settings. Being tattooed or pierced with tools or inks that were not sterilized after being used on someone who has HCV. Having contact with the blood or open sores of someone who has HCV. Sharing personal care items that may have come in contact with another person's blood, such as razors or toothbrushes. Being born to a mother with HCV. Having unprotected sex with someone who has HCV.   Before 1992, hepatitis C was also commonly spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants. Since then, there has been routine testing of the U.S. blood supply for HCV. It is now very rare for someone to get HCV this way.   Who is more likely to get hepatitis C? You are more likely to get hepatitis C if you: Have injected drugs Had a blood transfusion or organ transplant before July 1992 Have hemophilia and received clotting factor before 1987 Have been on kidney dialysis Have been in contact with blood or infected needles at work Have had tattoos or body piercings Have worked or lived in a prison Were born to a mother with hepatitis C Have HIV Have had more than one sex partner in the last 6 months Have had a sexually transmitted infection (STI) Are a man who has had sex with men (MSM)   If you are at high risk for hepatitis C, your health care provider will likely recommend that you get tested for it.   What are the symptoms of hepatitis C? Most people with hepatitis C have no symptoms. Some people with acute hepatitis C do have symptoms within 1 to 3 months after they are exposed to the virus. These symptoms may include: Dark yellow urine Fatigue Fever Gray- or clay-colored stools Joint pain Loss of appetite Nausea and/or vomiting Pain in your abdomen (belly) Jaundice (yellowish eyes and skin)   If you have chronic hepatitis C, you probably will not have symptoms until it causes complications. This can happen decades after you were infected. For this reason, hepatitis C screening is important, even if you have no symptoms.   What other problems can hepatitis C cause? Without treatment, hepatitis C may lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. Early diagnosis and treatment of hepatitis C can prevent these complications.   How is hepatitis C diagnosed? Providers diagnose hepatitis C based on your medical history, a physical exam, and blood tests.  If you do have hepatitis C, you may need additional tests to check for liver damage. These tests may include other blood tests, an ultrasound of the liver, and a liver biopsy.   What are the treatments for hepatitis C? Treatment for hepatitis C is with antiviral medicines. They can cure the disease in most cases.  If you have acute hepatitis C, your provider may wait to see if your infection becomes chronic before starting treatment. If your hepatitis C causes cirrhosis, you should see a doctor who specializes in liver diseases. Treatments for health problems related to cirrhosis include medicines, surgery, and other medical procedures. If your hepatitis C leads to liver failure or liver cancer, you may need a liver transplant.   Can hepatitis C be prevented? There is no vaccine for hepatitis C. But you can help protect yourself from hepatitis C infection by: Not sharing drug needles or other drug materials. Wearing gloves if you have to touch another person's blood or open sores. Making sure your tattoo artist or body piercer uses sterile tools and unopened ink. Not sharing personal items such toothbrushes, razors, or nail clippers. Using a latex condom during sex.

    "disease": "Heroin",
    "summary": "What is heroin? Heroin is an illegal, very addictive opioid drug. It's made from morphine, which comes from the seedpod of opium poppy plants. These plants grow in Southeast and Southwest Asia, Mexico, and Colombia. Heroin can be a white or brown powder, or a black sticky substance known as black tar heroin.  How do people use heroin? People inject, sniff, snort, or smoke heroin. Some people mix heroin with crack cocaine, which is called \"speedballing.\" All these ways of taking heroin send it to the brain very quickly, which makes it highly addictive.  What are the short-term effects of heroin? People who use heroin report feeling a \"rush\" (a surge of pleasure). And then they may feel other effects, such as a warm flushing of the skin, dry mouth, and a heavy feeling in the arms and legs. They may also have severe itching, nausea, and vomiting. After these first effects, they will usually be drowsy for several hours, and their breathing will slow down.  What are the long-term effects of heroin? People who use heroin over the long term may develop many different health problems. These problems could include liver, kidney, and lung disease, mental disorders, and abscesses.  People who inject the drug also risk getting infectious diseases such as HIV, hepatitis, and bacterial infections of the skin, bloodstream, and heart (endocarditis). They can also get collapsed veins. When a vein collapses, the blood cannot flow through it.  Repeated use of heroin can lead to tolerance. This means users need more and more of the drug to have the same effect. At higher doses over time, the body becomes dependent on heroin. If someone who is dependent on heroin stops using it, they have withdrawal symptoms. These symptoms can include restlessness, muscle and bone pain, diarrhea, vomiting, and cold flashes with goose bumps.   Repeated use of heroin often leads to heroin use disorder, sometimes called addiction. This is more than physical dependence. It's a chronic (long-lasting) brain disorder. When someone has it, they continue to use heroin even though it causes problems in their life. Some examples include health problems and not being able to meet responsibilities at work, school, or home. Getting and using heroin becomes their main purpose in life.  Can a person overdose on heroin? It's possible to overdose on heroin. This happens when a person uses so much heroin that it causes a life-threatening reaction or death. All heroin users are at risk of an overdose because they never know the actual strength of the drug they are taking or what may have been added to it. Most heroin available in the United States is combined with illegally made fentanyl (IMF). Using heroin combined with IMF, or along with other drugs or alcohol can increase the risk of an overdose.  When people overdose on heroin, their heart rate and breathing slow down. Their breathing may slow do so much that not enough oxygen reaches the brain. This condition is called hypoxia. Hypoxia can lead to a coma, permanent brain damage, or death.  How can a heroin overdose be treated? A medicine called naloxone can treat a heroin (or other opioid) overdose if it is given in time. It works by blocking the effects of the opioid on the body. Sometimes more than one dose of the medicine is needed.   There are two forms of naloxone that anyone can use without medical training: nasal spray and injectable. People at risk of an overdose are encouraged to carry naloxone with them. They can buy naloxone at a pharmacy.  What are the treatments for heroin use disorder? Treatments for heroin use disorder include medicines to treat withdrawal symptoms, medicine to block the effects of opioids, and behavioral treatments. Often, a combination of medicine and behavioral treatment works best. People getting treatment for heroin use disorder should work with their health care providers to come up with a treatment plan that fits their needs.  NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse",

    "summary": "A hiatal hernia is a condition in which the upper part of your stomach bulges through an opening in your diaphragm. Your diaphragm is the thin muscle that separates your chest from your abdomen. Your diaphragm helps keep acid from coming up into your esophagus. When you have a hiatal hernia, it's easier for the acid to come up. This leaking of acid from your stomach into your esophagus is called GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). GERD may cause symptoms such as : Heartburn Problems swallowing A dry cough Bad breath Nausea and/or vomiting Breathing problems The wearing away of your teeth   Often, the cause of a hiatal hernia is unknown. It may have to do with weakness in the surrounding muscles. Sometimes the cause is an injury or a birth defect. Your risk of getting a hiatal hernia goes up as you age; they are common in people over age 50. You are also at higher risk if you have obesity or smoke.  People usually find out that they have a hiatal hernia when they are getting tests for GERD, heartburn, chest pain, or abdominal pain. The tests may be a chest x-ray, an x-ray with a barium swallow, or an upper endoscopy.  You don't need treatment if your hiatal hernia does not cause any symptoms or problems. If you do have symptoms, some lifestyle changes may help. They include eating small meals, avoiding certain foods, not smoking or drinking alcohol, and losing weight.

    "summary": "What is hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)?  Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic skin disease. Another name for it is acne inversa. It causes painful, boil-like lumps that form under the skin. It often affects areas where the skin rubs together, such as your armpits and groin. The lumps become inflamed and painful. They often break open, causing abscesses that drain fluid and pus. As the abscesses heal, they can cause scarring of the skin.  What causes hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)? The lumps in HS form because of blockages of the hair follicles. The blocked hair follicles trap bacteria, which leads to inflammation and rupture. In most cases, the cause of the blockages is unknown. Genetics, environment, and hormonal factors may play a role. Some cases of HS are caused by changes in certain genes.  HS is not caused by bad hygiene, and it cannot be spread to others.  Who is more likely to get hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)? HS usually starts after puberty, usually in the teens or twenties. It is more common in: Women People who are Black People with a family history of HS People who are overweight or have obesity People who smoke   What are the symptoms of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)? The symptoms of HS include: Small pitted areas of skin containing blackheads Painful, red, lumps that get bigger and break open. This causes abscesses that drain fluid and pus. They may itch and have an unpleasant odor. The abscesses heal very slowly, recur over time, and can lead to scarring and tunnels under the skin.   HS can be mild, moderate, or severe: In mild HS, there are only one or a few lumps in one area of the skin. A mild case will often get worse, becoming a moderate disease. Moderate HS includes recurrences of the lumps that get bigger and break open. The lumps form in more than one area of the body.   With severe HS, there are widespread lumps, scarring, and chronic pain that may make it hard to move.   Because of the difficulty of dealing with the disease, people with HS are at risk for depression and anxiety.  How is hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) diagnosed? There is no specific test for HS. It can be hard to diagnose in the early stages because it can look like pimples or acne. To make a diagnosis, your health care provider:   Will ask about your medical history and your symptoms Will look at the lumps on your skin May take a sample of the skin or pus (if there is any) and send it to a lab to be tested   Your provider may refer you to a dermatologist (skin doctor) to get a diagnosis or treatment.   What are the treatments for hidradenitis suppurativa?  There is no cure for HS. Treatments focus on the symptoms, but they are not always effective for everyone. The treatments depend on how severe the disease is and may include: Medicines, including steroids, antibiotics, pain relievers, and medicines that flight inflammation. In mild cases, the medicines may be topical (applied to your skin). Otherwise, the medicines may be injected or taken orally (by mouth). Procedures or surgery to remove the lumps and scars or make the sores go away.

    "disease": "High Blood Pressure",
    "summary": "What is blood pressure? Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is called diastolic pressure.  Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually the systolic number comes before or above the diastolic number. For example, 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80.  How is high blood pressure diagnosed? High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. They will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis.         Blood Pressure Category  Systolic Blood Pressure    Diastolic Blood Pressure          Normal  Less than 120  and  Less than 80      Elevated  120 - 129  and  Less than 80      High Blood Pressure Stage 1  130 - 139  or  80 - 89      High Blood Pressure Stage 2  140 or higher  or  90 or higher       Hypertensive Crisis (dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away)  Higher than 180  and  Higher than 120          For children and teens, the health care provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and sex.  What are the different types of high blood pressure? There are two main types of high blood pressure: Primary, or essential, high blood pressure. This is the most common type of high blood pressure. For most people who get this kind of blood pressure, it develops over time as you get older.  Secondary high blood pressure. This is caused by another medical condition or use of certain medicines. It usually gets better after you treat that condition or stop taking the medicines that are causing it.   Why do I need to worry about high blood pressure? When your blood pressure stays high over time, it causes the heart to pump harder and work overtime, possibly leading to serious health problems such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and kidney failure.  What are the treatments for high blood pressure? Treatments for high blood pressure include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines.  You will work with your provider to come up with a treatment plan. It may include only the lifestyle changes. These changes, such as heart-healthy eating and exercise, can be very effective. But sometimes the changes do not control or lower your high blood pressure. Then you may need to take medicine. There are different types of blood pressure medicines. Some people need to take more than one type.  If your high blood pressure is caused by another medical condition or medicine, treating that condition or stopping the medicine may lower your blood pressure.

    "summary": "What is high blood pressure in pregnancy? Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Your arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to other parts of your body. High blood pressure, or hypertension, is blood pressure that is higher than normal. Having high blood pressure can put you at risk for other health problems, such as heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.  During pregnancy, high blood pressure can cause problems for you and your baby. To keep you and your baby healthy, it's important to get treatment for high blood pressure before, during, and after pregnancy.  What are the types of high blood pressure in pregnancy? There are different types of high blood pressure in pregnancy:  Gestational hypertension is high blood pressure that you develop while you are pregnant. It starts after you are 20 weeks pregnant. You usually don't have any other symptoms. In many cases, it does not harm you or your baby, and it goes away within 12 weeks after childbirth. But it does raise your risk of high blood pressure in the future. If it becomes severe, it can lead to a preterm birth or your baby having a low birth weight. Some women with gestational hypertension do go on to develop preeclampsia, a more serious type of high blood pressure in pregnancy. Chronic hypertension is high blood pressure that starts before the 20th week of pregnancy or before you became pregnant. Some people may have had it long before becoming pregnant but didn't know it until they got their blood pressure checked at their prenatal visit. Sometimes chronic hypertension can also lead to preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a sudden increase in blood pressure after the 20th week of pregnancy. It usually happens in the last trimester. Preeclampsia also often includes signs of damage to some of your organs, such as your liver or kidneys. The signs may include protein in the urine (pee) and very high blood pressure. Preeclampsia can be serious or even life-threatening for both you and your baby.      If preeclampsia becomes severe enough to affect your brain function and causes seizures or a coma, it is called eclampsia.   In rare cases, preeclampsia symptoms may not start until after delivery. This is called postpartum preeclampsia. If this type of preeclampsia becomes more severe and causes a seizure, it is known as postpartum eclampsia.    When a person with preeclampsia or eclampsia has damage to the liver and blood cells, it's called HELLP syndrome. It is rare, but very serious.       Who is more likely to develop high blood pressure in pregnancy? You are more likely to develop high blood pressure in pregnancy if you:  Had chronic high blood pressure or chronic kidney disease before pregnancy Had high blood pressure or preeclampsia in a previous pregnancy Have obesity Are under age 20 or over age 40 Are pregnant with more than one baby Are African American Have a family history of high blood pressure in pregnancy Have certain health conditions, such as diabetes or lupus \t  What are the symptoms of high blood pressure in pregnancy? High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. People usually find out they have high blood pressure when their health care provider measures their blood pressure. Preeclampsia can cause other symptoms, including:  Too much protein in your urine (called proteinuria). Swelling (edema) in your face and hands. Your feet may also swell, but many women have swollen feet during pregnancy. So swollen feet by themselves may not be a sign of a problem. A headache that does not go away. Vision problems, including blurred vision or seeing spots. Pain in your upper right abdomen (belly). Trouble breathing.   Eclampsia can also cause seizures, nausea and/or vomiting, and low urine output.   If you go on to develop HELLP syndrome, you may also have bleeding or bruising easily, extreme fatigue, and liver failure.  What problems can high blood pressure in pregnancy cause? High blood pressure in pregnancy can lead to complications such as:  Placental abruption, where the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby) separates from the uterus (the place where a baby grows during pregnancy) Poor fetal growth, caused by a lack of nutrients and oxygen Preterm birth Your baby having a low birth weight Damage to your kidneys, liver, brain, and other organ and blood systems A higher risk of heart disease for you   How is high blood pressure in pregnancy diagnosed? Your provider will check your blood pressure and urine at each prenatal visit. If your blood pressure reading is high (140/90 or higher), especially after the 20th week of pregnancy, your provider will likely want to order some tests. These may include blood tests and other lab tests, such as a test to look for extra protein in your urine.  What are the treatments for high blood pressure in pregnancy? If you have high blood pressure, you and your baby will be closely monitored to lower the chance of complications. You may need to:  Check your blood pressure at home. Keep track of how many times you feel the baby kicking each day. Adjust your physical activity. Talk to your provider about what level of physical activity is right for you. Take medicine to control your blood pressure. Talk to your provider about which medicines are safe for your baby.  Take aspirin in the second trimester, if you are at risk of preeclampsia and your provider recommends aspirin. Visit your provider more often to monitor your condition and your baby's growth rate and heart rate.   If you have eclampsia, HELLP syndrome, or a severe case of preeclampsia, you will most likely need to go to the hospital. Treatment often includes medicines. Your provider may also recommend delivering the baby early. They will make the decision based on:  How severe the condition is The possible risks to you and your baby How far along the pregnancy is   The goal is to lower the risks to you while giving your baby as much time as possible to mature before delivery.   The symptoms of preeclampsia can last after delivery, but they usually go away within 6 weeks.",

Three main factors contribute to high cholesterol in children and teens: An unhealthy diet, especially one that is high in saturated fats A family history of high cholesterol, especially when one or both parents have high cholesterol Having obesity   Some diseases, such as diabetes, kidney disease, and certain thyroid diseases, can also cause high cholesterol in children and teens.  What are the symptoms of high cholesterol in children and teens? There are usually no signs or symptoms that your child or teen has high cholesterol.  How do I know if my child or teen has high cholesterol? There is a blood test to measure cholesterol levels. The test gives information about:  Total cholesterol. This is a measure of the total amount of cholesterol in your blood. It includes both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. LDL cholesterol. LDL is often called \"bad\" cholesterol because it is the main source of cholesterol buildup and blockage in the arteries. HDL cholesterol. HDL is often called \"good\" cholesterol because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries. Non-HDL. This number is your total cholesterol minus your HDL. Your non-HDL includes LDL and other types of cholesterol such as VLDL (very-low-density lipoprotein). Triglycerides. This is another type of fat in your blood that can raise the risk of heart disease.   For anyone aged 19 or younger, the healthy levels of cholesterol are                            Type of Cholesterol             Healthy Level                                         Total Cholesterol             Less than 170 mg/dL                                      Non-HDL             Less than 120 mg/dL                                      LDL             Less than 110 mg/dL                                      HDL             More than 45 mg/dL                         When and how often your child or teen should get this test depends on their age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are: The first test should be between ages 9 to 11 Children should have the test again every 5 years Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke    What are the treatments for high cholesterol in children and teens? Lifestyle changes are the main treatment for high cholesterol in children and teens. These changes include: Being more active. This includes getting regular physical activity and spending less time sitting (in front of a television, at a computer, on a phone or tablet, etc.). Healthy eating. A diet to lower cholesterol includes limiting foods that are high in saturated fat, sugar, and cholesterol. It is also important to eat plenty of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.  Losing weight, if your child or teen is overweight or has obesity.   If everyone in the family makes these changes, it will be easier for your child or teen to stick to them. It is also an opportunity to improve your health, and the health of the rest of your family.  Sometimes these lifestyle changes are not enough to lower your child or teen's cholesterol. Their health care provider may consider giving your child or teen cholesterol medicines if they: Are at least 10 years old. Have an LDL (bad) cholesterol level that is higher than 190 mg/dL, even after six months of diet and exercise changes. Have an LDL (bad) cholesterol level that is higher than 160 mg/dL AND are at high risk for heart disease. Have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). FH is an inherited disorder that causes very high levels of cholesterol in the blood.",

    "summary": "Your hip is the joint where your femur (thigh bone) meets your pelvis (hip bone). There are two main parts: a ball at the end of the femur, which fits in a socket in the pelvis. Your hip is known as a ball-and-socket joint. This is because you have a ball at the end of your femur, and it fits into a socket in your pelvis. This makes your hips very stable and allows for a wide range of motion. When they are healthy, it takes great force to hurt them. However, playing sports, running, overuse, or falling can sometimes lead to hip injuries such as: \tStrains \tBursitis \tDislocations \tFractures (broken bones)   Certain diseases also lead to hip injuries or problems. Osteoarthritis can cause pain  and limited motion. Osteoporosis of the hip causes weak bones that break easily. Both of  these are common in older people.  Another problem is hip dysplasia, where the ball at the end of the femur is loose in the hip socket. It can cause hip dislocation. Babies who have hip dysplasia are usually born with it, but sometimes they develop it later.  Treatment for hip disorders may include rest, medicines, physical therapy, or surgery, including hip replacement.",

This fungus is common in the central and eastern United States, especially around the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys. It can also be found in parts of Central and South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. It lives in the environment, especially in soil that contains large amounts of bat or bird droppings (poop).   How do you get histoplasmosis? You get histoplasmosis by breathing in Histoplasma fungal spores from the air. It usually happens after you have been doing an activity that disturbs the soil, such as farming, construction, and landscaping. Histoplasmosis is not contagious. This means that you cannot get the infection from another person or an animal.   What are the symptoms of histoplasmosis? Most people who breathe in the spores never have any symptoms. If you do get symptoms, they usually start between 3 and 17 days after you breathe in the spores. The symptoms may include:  Fever Cough Fatigue Chills Headache Chest pain Body aches  For most people, the symptoms of histoplasmosis will go away within a few weeks to a month. However, some people can have symptoms that last longer, especially if their infection becomes severe. Certain people are more likely to get a severe infection:   People who have weakened immune systems, for example from: \t \t\tHaving HIV \t\tHaving had an organ transplant \t\tTaking medicines which weaken your immune system, such as chemotherapy and steroids \t  Infants Adults age 55 and over  Severe histoplasmosis can develop into a long-term lung infection. It can also spread from the lungs to other parts of the body, such as the central nervous system (the brain and spinal cord). This is known as disseminated histoplasmosis.  How is histoplasmosis diagnosed? To find out if you have histoplasmosis, your health care provider:  Will ask about your symptoms and your medical and travel history Will do a physical exam Will likely order a blood, urine, or tissue test to look for signs of the fungus May order a chest x-ray or CT scan of the lungs   What are the treatments for histoplasmosis? For some people, the symptoms of histoplasmosis will go away without treatment. But you will need treatment if you have severe histoplasmosis in the lungs, chronic histoplasmosis, or an infection that has spread to other parts of the body. That treatment would be with prescription antifungal medicines. In some cases, you may need to take the medicines for 3 months to 1 year.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

    "summary": "What is HIV? HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. HIV harms your immune system by destroying a type of white blood cell that helps your body fight infection. This puts you at risk for other infections and diseases.   What is AIDS? AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. It happens when the body's immune system is badly damaged because of the virus. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.  How does HIV spread? HIV is spread through certain body fluids from a person who has HIV. This can happen:  By having unprotected vaginal or anal sex with a person who has HIV. \"Unprotected\" means not using condoms or medicine to treat or prevent HIV. This is the most common way that it spreads. By sharing drug needles. Through contact with the blood of a person with HIV. From mother to fetus during pregnancy. From mother to baby during, childbirth, or breastfeeding.   Who is at risk for HIV infection? Anyone can get HIV, but certain groups have a higher risk of getting it:  People who have another sexually transmitted infection (STI). Having an STI can increase your risk of getting or spreading HIV. People who inject drugs with shared needles. Gay and bisexual men.   Black/African Americans and Hispanic/Latino Americans. They make up a higher proportion of new HIV diagnoses and people with HIV, compared to other races and ethnicities.  People who engage in risky sexual behaviors, such as not using condoms or medicine to prevent or treat HIV.   Factors such as stigma, discrimination, income, education, and geographic region can also affect people's risk for HIV.  What are the symptoms of HIV? The first signs of HIV infection may be flu-like symptoms:  Fever  Chills  Rash  Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep)  Muscle aches  Sore throat  Fatigue  Swollen lymph nodes  Mouth ulcers    These symptoms may come and go within two to four weeks. This stage is called acute HIV infection.  If the infection is not treated, it becomes chronic HIV infection. Often, there are no symptoms during this stage. If it is not treated, eventually the virus will weaken your body's immune system. Then the infection will progress to AIDS. This is the late stage of HIV infection. Because your immune system is badly damaged, your body cannot fight off other infections, called opportunistic infections (OIs). OIs are infections that happen more frequently or are more severe in people who have weakened immune systems. Some people may not feel sick during the earlier stages of HIV infection. So the only way to know for sure whether you have HIV is to get tested.  How do I know if I have HIV? A blood test can tell if you have HIV infection. Your health care provider can do the test, or you can use a home testing kit. You can also use the CDC Testing Locator to find free testing sites.  What are the treatments for HIV? There is no cure for HIV infection, but it can be treated with medicines. This is called antiretroviral therapy (ART).  ART can make HIV infection a manageable chronic condition. It also reduces the risk of spreading the virus to others.  Most people with HIV live long and healthy lives if they get ART as soon as possible and stay on it. It's also important to take care of yourself. Making sure that you have the support you need, living a healthy lifestyle, and getting regular medical care can help you enjoy a better quality of life.   Can HIV infection be prevented? You can reduce the risk of getting or spreading HIV by:   Getting tested for HIV. Choosing less risky sexual behaviors. This includes limiting the number of sexual partners you have and using latex condoms every time you have sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. Getting tested and treated for sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Not injecting drugs. Talking to your provider about medicines to prevent HIV: \t \t\tPrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) is for people who don't already have HIV but are at very high risk of getting it. PrEP is daily medicine that can reduce this risk.  \t\tPEP (post-exposure prophylaxis) is for people who have possibly been exposed to HIV. It is only for emergency situations. PEP must be started within 72 hours after a possible exposure to HIV. \t    NIH: National Institutes of Health",

If you find out that do have HIV, you can start treatment right away to protect your health and the health of your baby.  If I have HIV, can I pass it on to my baby during pregnancy? If you are pregnant and have HIV, there is a risk of passing HIV to your baby. It can happen in three ways:  During pregnancy During childbirth, especially if it is vaginal childbirth During breastfeeding   But having HIV doesn't mean that you can't have children. Treatment with a combination of HIV medicines can help prevent passing HIV to your baby and protect your own health.  If I have HIV, how can I prevent giving it to my baby? There are several different steps you can take to help prevent passing HIV to your baby:  Taking HIV medicines. HIV medicines reduce the amount of HIV in the body (viral load) to a very low level. The goal is to get your viral load so low that a standard lab test can't detect it. This is called having an \"undetectable viral load.\" Having an undetectable viral load is the best thing you can do to stay healthy and prevent your baby from getting HIV.  These medicines will also help protect your health. Most HIV medicines are safe to use during pregnancy. They don't usually raise the risk of birth defects. But it is important to talk with your health care provider about the risks and benefits of the different medicines. Together you can decide which medicines are right for you. Then you need to make sure you take your medicines regularly.  If needed, having a cesarean delivery. If your viral load is not reduced enough by the medicines, having a cesarean delivery (C-Section) can help prevent passing HIV to your baby.    Giving HIV medicines to the baby. Your baby will get HIV medicines as soon as possible after birth. The medicines protect your baby from infection from any HIV that passed from you during childbirth. Which medicine your baby gets depends on several factors, including what your viral load was just before you gave birth. Your baby will need to take medicines for 4 to 6 weeks. He or she will get several HIV tests over the first few months.  Not breastfeeding. Breast milk can have HIV in it. In the United States, infant formula is safe and readily available. So the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that if you have HIV, you should feed your baby formula instead of breastfeeding.    What if I want to get pregnant and my partner has HIV? If you are trying to get pregnant, it's important for your partner to also get tested for HIV.   If your partner does have HIV and you do not, talk to your provider about taking PrEP. PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. This means taking medicines to prevent HIV.

AIDS stands for acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. It is the final stage of infection with HIV. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.  What is antiretroviral therapy (ART)?  The treatment of HIV with medicines is called antiretroviral therapy (ART). It involves taking a combination of medicines every day. ART is recommended for everyone who has HIV. The medicines do not cure HIV infection, but help people with HIV live longer, healthier lives. They also reduce the risk of spreading the virus to others.  How do HIV medicines work? HIV medicines reduce the amount of HIV (viral load) in your body, which helps by: Giving your immune system a chance to recover. Even though there is still some HIV in your body, your immune system should be strong enough to fight off infections and certain HIV-related cancers. Reducing the risk that you will spread HIV to others.   What are the types of HIV medicines? There are many different types (called classes) of HIV medicines. Some work by blocking or changing enzymes that HIV needs to make copies of itself. This prevents HIV from copying itself, which reduces the amount of HIV in the body. Several types of medicines do this: Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) block an enzyme called reverse transcriptase Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) bind to and later change reverse transcriptase Integrase inhibitors, also called integrase strand transfer inhibitors (INSTIs), block an enzyme called integrase Protease inhibitors (PIs) block an enzyme called protease   Some types of HIV medicines interfere with HIV's ability to infect CD4 immune system cells: Fusion inhibitors block HIV from entering the cells CCR5 antagonists and post-attachment inhibitors block different molecules on the CD4 cells. To infect a cell, HIV has to bind to two types of molecules on the cell's surface. Blocking either of these molecules prevents HIV from entering the cells. Attachment inhibitors bind to a specific protein on the outer surface of HIV. This prevents HIV from entering the cell.   Pharmacokinetic enhancers are another type of medicine. They are sometimes taken along with certain other HIV medicines. Pharmacokinetic enhancers increase the effectiveness of the other medicine. They work by slowing the breakdown of the other medicine. This allows that medicine to stay in the body longer at a higher concentration.  There are also multidrug combinations, which include a combination of two or more different types of HIV medicines.  When do I need to start taking HIV medicines? It's important to start taking HIV medicines as soon as possible after your diagnosis, especially if you: Are pregnant Have AIDS Have certain HIV-related illnesses and infections Have an early HIV infection (the first 6 months after infection with HIV)   What else do I need to know about taking HIV medicines?  You and your health care provider will work together to come up with a personal treatment plan. This plan will be based on many factors, including:  The possible side effects of HIV medicines Potential drug interactions with any other medicines you take How many medicines you will need to take every day Any other health problems you may have   It's important to take your medicines every day, according to the instructions from your provider. If you miss doses or don't follow a regular schedule, your treatment may not work, and the HIV virus may become resistant to the medicines.  HIV medicines can cause side effects. Most of these side effects are manageable, but a few can be serious. Tell your provider about any side effects that you are having. Don't stop taking your medicine without first talking to your provider. There may be steps you can take to help manage the side effects. In some cases, your provider may decide to change your medicines.  What are HIV PrEP and PEP medicines? HIV medicines are not just used for treatment. Some people take them to prevent HIV.

    "summary": "What are PrEP and PEP? PrEP and PEP are medicines to prevent HIV. Each type is used in a different situation:  PrEP stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis. It is for people who don't already have HIV but are at risk of getting it. PrEP is medicine that can reduce this risk. You can take it as a pill every day or as an injection every two or six months. With PrEP, if you do get exposed to HIV, the medicine can stop HIV from taking hold and spreading throughout your body. PEP stands for post-exposure prophylaxis. PEP is for people who have possibly been exposed to HIV. It is only for emergency situations. PEP must be started within 72 hours after a possible exposure to HIV.   PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis)  Who should consider taking PrEP? PrEP can help protect you if you don't have HIV and any of these applies to you:  You have had anal or vaginal sex in the past 6 months and:      Have a sexual partner with HIV,    Have not consistently used a condom, OR   Have been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the past 6 months     You inject drugs and:      Share needles or other equipment to inject drugs OR   Have an injection partner with HIV     You have been prescribed PEP and:      Continue engaging in high-risk behaviors OR   Have used multiple courses of PEP       If you have a partner who is HIV-positive and are considering getting pregnant, talk to your health care provider about PrEP. Taking it may help protect you and your fetus or baby from getting an HIV infection while you try to get pregnant, during pregnancy, or while breastfeeding.  How well does PrEP work? PrEP is very effective when you take it consistently. It reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99%. In people who inject drugs, it reduces the risk of HIV by at least 74%. PrEP is much less effective if you do not take it consistently. PrEP does not protect against other STIs, so you should still use latex condoms every time you have sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. You must have an HIV test every 3 months while taking PrEP, so you'll have regular follow-up visits with your provider. If you are having trouble taking PrEP every day or if you want to stop taking PrEP, talk to your provider.  Does PrEP cause side effects? Some people taking PrEP may have side effects, like nausea. The side effects are usually not serious and often get better over time. If you are taking PrEP, tell your provider if you have a side effect that bothers you or that does not go away.  PEP (post-exposure prophylaxis)  Who should consider taking PEP? If you are HIV-negative and you think you may have been recently exposed to HIV, contact your health care provider immediately or go to an emergency room right away. You may be prescribed PEP if you are HIV negative or don't know your HIV status, and in the last 72 hours you may have been exposed to HIV:  During sex, for example if a condom broke during sex with someone who could have HIV, Through the sharing of needles or drug preparation equipment Through sexual assault   Your provider or emergency room doctor will help to decide whether PEP is right for you. PEP may also be given to a health care worker after a possible exposure to HIV at work, for example, from a needlestick injury.  When should I start PEP and how long do I need to take it? PEP must be started within 72 hours (3 days) after a possible exposure to HIV. The sooner you start it, the better; every hour counts. You need to take the PEP medicines every day for 28 days. You will have to see your provider at certain times during and after taking the PEP, so you can have an HIV screening test and other testing.   Does PEP cause side effects? Some people taking PEP may have side effects, like nausea. The side effects are usually not serious and often get better over time. If you are taking PEP, tell your provider if you have a side effect that bothers you or that does not go away. PEP medicines may also interact with other medicines that a person is taking (called a drug interaction). So it's important to tell your provider about any other medicines that you take.  Can I take PEP every time I have unprotected sex? PEP is only for emergency situations. It is not the right choice for people who may be exposed to HIV frequently - for example, if you often have sex without a condom with a partner who is HIV-positive. In that case, you should talk to your health care provider about whether PrEP (pre-exposure prophylaxis) would be right for you.",

In the years before and during menopause, the levels of female hormones can go up and down. This can cause symptoms such as hot flashes, night sweats, pain during sex, and vaginal dryness. For some women, the symptoms are mild, and they go away on their own. Other women take hormone replacement therapy (HRT), also called menopausal hormone therapy, to relieve these symptoms. HRT may also protect against osteoporosis.   HRT is not for everyone. You should not use HRT if you:  Think that you are pregnant Have problems with vaginal bleeding Have had certain kinds of cancers Have had a stroke or heart attack Have had blood clots Have liver disease   There are different types of HRT. Some have only one hormone, while others have two. Most are pills that you take every day, but there are also skin patches, vaginal creams, gels, and rings.   Taking HRT has some risks. For some women, hormone therapy may increase their chances of getting blood clots, heart attacks, strokes, breast cancer, and gallbladder disease. Certain types of HRT have a higher risk, and each woman's own risks can vary, depending upon her medical history and lifestyle. You and your health care provider need to discuss the risks and benefits for you. If you do decide to take HRT, it should be the lowest dose that helps and for the shortest time needed.

    "summary": "Regular exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health. It has many benefits. It can improve your overall health and fitness and reduce your risk for many chronic diseases. To get the most benefit, here's how much physical activity you should get:  For adults  Get at least 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity each week. Or you could do a combination of the two:  Try to spread your physical activity out over several days of the week. That's better than trying to do it all in one or two days. Some days you may not have long blocks of time to do physical activity. You can start slowly and break your exercise time into chunks. Even small amounts of exercise can be helpful.  Aerobic activities include walking fast, jogging, swimming, and biking. Moderate intensity means that while you are doing that activity you should be able to say a few words in a row but not sing.   Vigorous intensity means that while you are doing that activity, you won't be able to say more than a few words without stopping for a breath.   Also, do strengthening activities two or more days per week:  Strengthening activities include lifting weights, working with exercise bands, and doing sit-ups and pushups. Choose activities that work all parts of your body your legs, hips, back, chest, stomach, shoulders, and arms. For each exercise, try repeating the movement 8 to 12 times. As you get stronger, work up to doing 2 or 3 rounds of each exercise for the best results.    If you are an older adult, you may also benefit from a combination of activities that include aerobic exercises, strength or resistance training, and balance training. Balance training such as walking heel-to-toe or standing on one leg may help improve stability and prevent falls. Before you start exercising, check with your health care provider to determine the best type or amount of activity for you based on your fitness level and health.  For preschool-aged children (ages 3-5)  Preschool children should be physically active throughout the day, to help with their growth and development:   They should get both structured and unstructured active play. Structured play has a goal and is directed by an adult. Examples include playing a sport or a game. Unstructured play is creative free play, such as playing on a playground.   Encourage active play with a variety of activities.    For children and teens  Get 60 minutes or more of physical activity every day. Most of it should be moderate-intensity aerobic activity:  Activities should vary and be a good fit for the child's age and physical development Moderate-intensity aerobic activities include walking, running, skipping, playing on the playground, playing basketball, and biking   As part of the 60 minutes or more of daily physical activity, try to do each of these at least 3 days a week: vigorous-intensity aerobic activity, muscle-strengthening activity, and bone-strengthening activity:   Vigorous-intensity aerobic activities include running, jumping jacks, and fast swimming Muscle-strengthening activities include playing on playground equipment, playing tug-of-war, and doing pushups and pull-ups Bone-strengthening activities include hopping, skipping, jumping jacks, playing volleyball, and working with resistance bands   Older adults, pregnant women, and people with chronic health problems  Older adults, pregnant women, and people who have disabilities or special health needs should check with their provider on how much physical activity they should get and what types of activities they should do.   Exercise tips People who are trying to lose weight may need to get more physical activity. They also need to adjust their diet, so they are burning more calories than they eat and drink.  If you have been inactive, you may need to start exercising slowly. You can keep adding more gradually. The more you can do, the better. But try not to feel overwhelmed and do what you can. Getting some physical activity is always better than getting none. Even small increases in exercise can benefit your health.    NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "summary": "What is mental health? Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act as we cope with life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and the teen years through adulthood and older age.   Why is mental health important? Good mental health can help you:  Cope with stress Be physically healthy Have good relationships Make meaningful contributions to your community Work productively Realize your full potential   How can I improve my mental health? There are many ways to take care of your mental health, including:  Staying positive, which is the habit of seeing the good in situations and expecting things to work out well. Some ways to build a positive outlook include: \t \t\tFinding balance between positive and negative emotions. Staying positive doesn't mean that you never feel negative emotions, such as sadness or anger. These emotions can help you deal with problems. But you don't want those emotions to take over. For example, it's not helpful to dwell on bad memories or worry too much about the future.  \t\tTrying to hold on to good feelings when you have them. \t\tLimiting exposure to negative information. For example, take breaks from the news or social media if they make you feel upset. Use social media to connect, not to  get into arguments, or negatively compare your life to others. \t  Practicing gratitude, which means being thankful for the good things in your life. It's helpful to do this every day, either by thinking about what you are grateful for or writing it down in a journal. These can be big things, such as the support you have from loved ones, or little things, such as enjoying a nice meal. Practicing gratitude can help you notice moments when you have positive emotions, even during stressful times.  Taking care of your physical health, since your physical and mental health are connected. Some ways to take care of your physical health include: \t \t\tBeing physically active. Exercise reduces feelings of stress and depression and improves your mood. \t\tGetting enough sleep. Sleep affects your mood. If you don't sleep well, you may become more easily annoyed and angry. Over the long term, a lack of quality sleep can make you more likely to become depressed. So, it's important to make sure that you have a regular sleep schedule and get enough quality sleep every night. \t\tHealthy eating. Good nutrition may help you feel better physically, improve your mood and decrease anxiety and stress. Also, not having enough of certain nutrients may contribute to some mental illnesses.

It is also good to have different types of connections. Besides connecting with family and friends, you could find ways to get involved with your community or neighborhood. For example, you could volunteer for a local organization or join a group that is focused on a hobby you enjoy.  Developing a sense of meaning and purpose in life, which could be through your job, volunteering, learning new skills, or exploring your spirituality. Having a sense of purpose supports long-term emotional health. Developing coping skills, which are methods you use to deal with stressful situations. They may help you be flexible, face a difficult problem, and not easily give up until you  solve it. Meditation, which is a mind and body practice where you learn to focus your attention and awareness. There are many types, including mindfulness meditation and transcendental meditation. Meditation usually involves: \t \t\tA quiet location with as few distractions as possible. \t\tA comfortable position. This could be sitting, lying down, walking, or another position. \t\tA focus of attention, such as a specially chosen word or set of words, an object, or your breath. \t\tAn open attitude, where you try to let your thoughts come and go without judging them. \t  Relaxation techniques are practices you do to produce your body's natural relaxation response. This response slows down your breathing, lowers your blood pressure, and reduces muscle tension and stress. Types of relaxation techniques include: \t  \t\tProgressive relaxation, where you tighten and relax different muscle groups, sometimes while using mental imagery or breathing exercises. \t\tGuided imagery, where you focus on positive images in your mind to help you feel more relaxed and focused. \t\tBiofeedback, where you use electronic devices to learn to control certain body functions, such as breathing, heart rate, and muscle tension. \t\tSelf-hypnosis, where the practice of using a specific word, image, or cue can help you enter a relaxed, focused state that shapes your thoughts and behaviors in positive ways.  \t\tDeep breathing exercises, which involve focusing on taking slow, deep, even breaths to calm your body and mind. \t    It's also important to recognize when you need to get help. Talk therapy and/or medicines can treat many mental disorders. Start by talking with your health care provider for advice on where to get care.",

    "summary": "What is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly.  But if you have too much of it in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases.  Cholesterol is made by your liver. It travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type of lipoprotein, LDL, is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL, is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body.  There are steps that you can take to lower your LDL (bad) cholesterol and raise your HDL (good) cholesterol. By keeping your cholesterol levels in range, you can lower your risk of heart diseases.  What are the main treatments for high cholesterol? The main treatments for high cholesterol are lifestyle changes and medicines.  Lifestyle changes to lower cholesterol Heart-healthy lifestyle changes that can help you lower or control your cholesterol include: Heart-healthy eating. A heart-healthy eating plan limits the amount of saturated and trans fats that you eat. It recommends that you eat and drink only enough calories to stay at a healthy weight and avoid weight gain. It also encourages you to choose a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. Examples of eating plans that can lower your cholesterol include the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet and the DASH eating plan.  Aiming for a healthy weight. If you are overweight or have obesity, losing weight can help lower your LDL cholesterol and raise your HDL cholesterol. This is especially important for people with metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a group of conditions that together raise your risk of heart diseases and other health problems. Getting regular physical activity. Studies have shown that physical activity can lower LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and raise your HDL cholesterol.  Before you start an exercise program, ask your health care provider what level of physical activity is right for you. Managing stress. Research has shown that chronic stress can sometimes raise your LDL cholesterol and lower your HDL cholesterol. Quitting smoking. Quitting smoking can raise your HDL cholesterol. Since HDL helps to remove LDL cholesterol from your arteries, having more HDL can help to lower your LDL cholesterol. Getting enough good-quality sleep. Getting 7 to 9 hours of sleep every night lowers your risk of high LDL  cholesterol and total cholesterol levels.   Medicines to lower cholesterol For some people, making lifestyle changes alone does not their lower cholesterol enough. They may also need to take cholesterol medicines. There are several types. They work in different ways and can have different side effects. If your provider recommends that you take cholesterol medicines, ask them which medicine would be right for you.    Even if you take medicines to lower your cholesterol, you still need to continue with lifestyle changes.   What are some other possible treatments for high cholesterol? Some other possible treatments for high cholesterol may include:  Lipoprotein apheresis to lower cholesterol Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited condition that causes very high levels of cholesterol in the blood. Some people who have FH may get a treatment called lipoprotein apheresis. This treatment uses a filtering machine to remove LDL cholesterol from your blood. Then the machine returns the rest of your blood back to your body.  Supplements to lower cholesterol Many companies sell supplements that they say can lower cholesterol. For many of these supplements, there isn't enough evidence to show that they can lower cholesterol levels. But for some supplements, research has found that they have cholesterol-lowering effects. For example:  Plant stanols and sterols supplements, when taken with meals, can reduce cholesterol levels. Some soy products have a small cholesterol-lowering effect. But research has found that eating soy foods gives you more of a benefit than taking supplements. Whole flaxseed and flaxseed lignans may help to lower cholesterol levels. However, flaxseed oil does not. Garlic supplements may lower cholesterol levels, but the effect is small when compared to the effects of cholesterol medicines.   Supplements may cause side effects and interactions with medicines. Always check with your provider before you take any supplements.",

How can I lower cholesterol with diet? Heart-healthy lifestyle changes include a diet to lower your cholesterol. The DASH eating plan is one example. Another is the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes (TLC) diet, which recommends that you:  Choose healthier fats.You should limit both total fat and saturated fat. No more than 25 to 35% of your daily calories should come from dietary fats, and less than 7% of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Depending upon how many calories you eat per day, here are the maximum amounts of saturated fats that you should eat:         Calories per Day  Saturated Fat           1,200  8 grams     1,500  10 grams      2,00013 grams      2,500  17 grams         Saturated fat is a bad fat because it raises your LDL (bad cholesterol) level more than anything else in your diet. It is found in some meats, dairy products, chocolate, baked goods, and deep-fried and processed foods.  Instead of saturated fats, switch to foods with healthier fats, such as lean meat, nuts, and unsaturated oils like canola, olive, and safflower oils.  Limit foods with cholesterol. If you are trying to lower your cholesterol, you should have less than 200 mg a day of cholesterol. Cholesterol is in foods from animals, such as liver and other organ meats, egg yolks, shrimp, and whole milk dairy products.  Eat plenty of soluble fiber. Soluble fiber helps prevent your digestive tract from absorbing cholesterol. You should try to get 10 to 25 grams of it per day. Foods that are high in soluble fiber include: Whole-grain cereals such as oatmeal and oat bran Fruits such as apples, bananas, oranges, pears, and prunes Legumes such as kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas, black-eyed peas, and lima beans   Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. They are important sources of vitamins, fiber, and other nutrients.  Increase plant stanols and sterols in your diet.These are substances that also help prevent your digestive tract from absorbing cholesterol. You should try to get 2 grams of them per day. They can be found in whole grains, nuts, legumes, and oils, such as olive oil and avocado oil. They are also added to some foods, such as certain types of orange juice, margarine, and bread.   Eat foods that are high in omega-3 fatty acids. These special fats can lower LDL and triglyceride levels. They can also help control blood pressure and may lower your risk of heart rhythm problems. If you have heart disease, they may lower your risk of heart attack.  Omega-3 fatty acids can be found in:  Fish such as salmon, tuna (canned or fresh), and mackerel. Most people should try to eat these fish two times a week. But if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, you should avoid fish that could be high in mercury, such as mackerel. Plant sources such as walnuts, flaxseed, chia seeds, and canola and soybean oils. But they have smaller amounts of omega-3 acids than the fish sources. Fortified foods, such as certain brands of eggs, yogurt, juices, milk, soy beverages, and infant formulas.   Limit salt. You should try to limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat to no more than 2,300 milligrams (about 1 teaspoon of salt) a day. That includes all the sodium you eat, whether it's added in cooking, used at the table, or already present in food products. Limiting salt won't lower your cholesterol, but it can lower your risk of heart diseases by helping to lower your blood pressure. You can reduce your sodium by instead choosing low-salt and \"no added salt\" foods and seasonings at the table or while cooking.  Limit alcohol. Alcohol adds extra calories, which can lead to weight gain. Being overweight can raise your LDL level and lower your HDL level. Too much alcohol can also increase your risk of heart diseases because it can raise your blood pressure and triglyceride level. It's best not to drink, but if you do:   Have no more than 2 drinks per day if you are a man Have no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman   Nutrition labels can help you figure out how much fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, fiber, and sodium is in the foods that you buy. This can help you eat healthier and lower your cholesterol.  NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "summary": "What is diabetes? Diabetes, also called diabetes mellitus, is a disease that causes your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels to be too high. There are three types of diabetes: type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes, and type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type and may be prevented, delayed, or managed by making lifestyle changes.  What is type 2 diabetes? If you have type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or doesn't use it well. This is called insulin resistance. Insulin is a hormone that helps glucose get into your cells. Glucose is your cells' main source of energy and comes from the foods you eat. If your body is resistant to insulin, then insulin can't get enough glucose into your cells. This then leads to glucose staying in your blood, leading to high blood glucose levels.   Over time, having too much glucose in your blood can cause health problems. If you are at risk for type 2 diabetes, you might be able to prevent or delay developing it.  Who is at risk for type 2 diabetes? Many people are at risk for type 2 diabetes. Your chances of getting it depend on a combination of risk factors such as your genes and lifestyle. The risk factors include:  Having prediabetes, which means you have blood glucose levels that are high for you, but not high enough to be called diabetes Being overweight or having obesity Being age 35 or older A family history of diabetes Being African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander Having high blood pressure Having a low level of HDL (good) cholesterol or a high level of triglycerides A history of diabetes in pregnancy Having given birth to a baby weighing 9 pounds or more An inactive lifestyle A history of heart disease or stroke Having depression Having polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) Having acanthosis nigricans, a skin condition in which your skin becomes dark and thick, especially around your neck or armpits Smoking   How can I prevent or delay getting type 2 diabetes? Most of the things that you need to do to prevent or delay getting type 2 diabetes involve having a healthier lifestyle. Lifestyle changes include:  Lose weight. Weight control is an important part of diabetes prevention. You may be able to prevent or delay diabetes by losing 5 to 7% of your current weight. For example, if you weigh 200 pounds, your goal would be to lose between 10 to 14 pounds. And once you lose the weight, it is important that you don't gain it back. Follow a healthy eating plan. It is important to reduce the amount of calories you eat and drink each day, so you can lose weight and keep it off. To do that, your diet should include smaller portions and less fat and sugar. You should also eat a variety of foods from each food group, including plenty of whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. It's also a good idea to limit red meat and avoid processed meats.  Get regular exercise. Being physically active has many health benefits, including helping you to lose weight and lower your blood glucose levels. These both lower your risk of type 2 diabetes. Try to get at least 30 minutes of physical activity on most days of the week. The amount of exercise you need depends on your age and health. Even small amounts of exercise can be helpful. If you have not been active, talk with your health care provider to figure out which types of exercise are best for you. You can start slowly and work up to your goal. Don't smoke. Smoking can contribute to insulin resistance, which can lead to type 2 diabetes. If you already smoke, try to quit.  Talk to your provider to see whether there is anything else you can do to delay or to prevent type 2 diabetes. If you are at high risk, your provider may suggest that you take one of a few types of diabetes medicines.   If you make these changes, you will get other health benefits as well. You may lower your risk of other diseases, and you will probably feel better and have more energy.  NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

For example:      African Americans are more likely than Whites to die of heart disease, while Hispanic Americans are less likely to die of it    Asian Americans as a group have lower rates of heart disease than other groups, but South Asian Americans have higher rates      Your family history. You have a greater risk if you have a close family member who had heart disease at an early age, for example if:      Your father or brother was diagnosed before age 55   Your mother or sister was diagnosed before age 65       What are the heart disease risk factors I can change and what can I do to lower my risk? There are many heart disease risk factors that you can change.  If you make these changes, you don't just help protect your heart. You can also improve your overall health and well-being.  You may have a lot of changes to make. If you need to, you can make the changes gradually, one at a time. What's most important is that you make them. Depending on your lifestyle, these changes could include:  Controlling your blood pressure. High blood pressure is a major risk factor for heart disease. It is important to get your blood pressure checked regularly - at least once a year for most adults, and more often if you have high blood pressure. You can also take steps, including lifestyle changes, to prevent or control high blood pressure.  Keeping your cholesterol and triglyceride levels under control:       High levels of cholesterol can clog your arteries and raise your risk of coronary artery disease and heart attack. Lifestyle changes and medicines (if needed) can lower your cholesterol.   Triglycerides are another type of fat in the blood. High  levels of triglyceride may also raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially in women.      Staying at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity can increase your risk of heart disease. This is mostly because they are linked to other heart disease risk factors, including high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Controlling your weight can lower these risks.  Eating a healthy diet. Try to limit saturated fats, foods high in sodium (salt), and added sugars. Instead, eat plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH diet is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure and cholesterol, two things that can lower your risk of heart disease.  Getting regular physical activity. Regular physical activity has many benefits, including strengthening your heart and improving your circulation. It can also help you maintain a healthy weight and lower cholesterol and blood pressure. All of these can lower your risk of heart disease.  Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain. Both of those raise your risk of heart disease. It's best not to drink, but if you do:      Have no more than 2 drinks per day if you are a man.   Have no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman.      Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk of heart attack and stroke.       If you do not smoke, don't start.    If you do smoke, quitting will lower your risk of heart disease. You can talk with your health care provider for help in finding the best way for you to quit.      Managing stress. Stress is linked to heart disease in many ways. It can raise your blood pressure. Extreme stress can be a \"trigger\" for a heart attack. Also, some common ways of coping with stress, such as overeating, heavy drinking, and smoking, are bad for your heart. Some ways to help manage your stress include exercise, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating.  Managing diabetes. Having diabetes doubles your risk of diabetic heart disease. That is because over time, high blood glucose (blood sugar) from diabetes can damage your blood vessels and the nerves that control your heart and blood vessels. So, it is important to get tested for diabetes, and if you have it, to keep it under control.  Getting enough sleep. If you don't get enough sleep, you raise your risk of high blood pressure, obesity, and diabetes. Those three things can raise your risk of heart disease. To improve your sleep:      If you are an adult, try to get 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night.    Make sure that you have good sleep habits, such as keeping a regular sleep schedule and creating a good sleeping environment in your bedroom.    If you have frequent sleep problems, contact your health care provider. One problem, sleep apnea, causes people to briefly stop breathing many times during sleep. This interferes with your ability to get a good rest and can raise your risk of heart disease. If you think you might have sleep apnea, ask your provider about having a sleep study. And if you do have sleep apnea, make sure that you get treatment for it.",

    "disease": "How to Prevent High Blood Pressure",
    "summary": "Around half of American adults have high blood pressure (hypertension). Many of those people don't know they have it because there are usually no warning signs. This can be dangerous, because high blood pressure can lead to life-threatening conditions like heart attack or stroke. The good news is that you can often prevent or treat high blood pressure. Early diagnosis and heart-healthy lifestyle changes can keep high blood pressure from seriously damaging your health.  What is blood pressure? Each time your heart beats, it pumps blood into your arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood from your heart to the tissues and organs in your body). Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Blood pressure is measured as two numbers:  Systolic pressure (the first and higher number) measures pressure inside your arteries when your heart beats Diastolic pressure (the second and lower number) measures the pressure inside your arteries when your heart rests between beats   As an example, a blood pressure reading of 120/80 means a systolic of 120 and a diastolic of 80.  How is high blood pressure diagnosed? High blood pressure usually has no symptoms. So the only way to find out if you have it is to get regular blood pressure checks from your health care provider. Your provider will use a gauge, a stethoscope or electronic sensor, and a blood pressure cuff. They will take two or more readings at separate appointments before making a diagnosis:         Blood Pressure Category  Systolic Blood Pressure    Diastolic Blood Pressure          Normal  Less than 120  and  Less than 80      Elevated  120 - 129  and  Less than 80      High Blood Pressure Stage 1  130 - 139  or  80 - 89      High Blood Pressure Stage 2  140 or higher  or  90 or higher       Hypertensive Crisis (dangerously high blood pressure - seek medical care right away)  Higher than 180  and  Higher than 120         For children and teens, the provider compares the blood pressure reading to what is normal for other kids who are the same age, height, and sex.   Who is more likely to develop high blood pressure? Anyone can develop high blood pressure, but there are certain factors that can increase your risk: Age. Blood pressure tends to rise with age. Race/Ethnicity. High blood pressure is more common in Black adults. They also tend to have higher average blood pressure numbers and get high blood pressure earlier in life. Sex. Men are more likely than women to develop high blood pressure throughout middle age. But in older adults, women are more likely than men to develop high blood pressure. Lifestyle. Certain lifestyle habits can raise your risk for high blood pressure, such as eating too much sodium (salt) or not enough potassium, lack of exercise, drinking too much alcohol, and smoking. Family history and genetics. High blood pressure often runs in families. Many genes are linked to small increases in high blood pressure risk. Social and economic factors:      Research shows that factors such as income, education level, where you live, and the type of job you have may raise your risk of high blood pressure. For example, working early or late shifts can raise your risk.   Experiencing discrimination and poverty has been linked to high blood pressure. Also, some research has shown that trauma in childhood may raise the risk of high blood pressure.     Certain medicines. Some medicines can raise your blood pressure, including:        Certain antidepressants   Decongestants (medicines to relieve a stuffy nose)   Hormonal birth control pills   Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which are a type of pain reliever     Having certain other medical conditions, such as:      Some tumors   Chronic kidney disease   Diabetes   Metabolic syndrome   Overweight and obesity   Sleep apnea   Thyroid problems       How can I prevent high blood pressure? You can help prevent high blood pressure by having a healthy lifestyle. This means: Eating a healthy diet. To help manage your blood pressure, you should limit the amount of sodium (salt) that you eat and increase the amount of potassium in your diet. It is also important to eat foods that are lower in fat, as well as plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. The DASH eating plan is an example of an eating plan that can help you to lower your blood pressure. Getting regular physical activity. Regular physical activity can help you maintain a healthy weight and lower your blood pressure.  Being at a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity increases your risk for high blood pressure. Maintaining a healthy weight can help you control high blood pressure and reduce your risk for other health problems.  Limiting alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can raise your blood pressure. It also adds extra calories, which may cause weight gain.  Not smoking. Cigarette smoking raises your blood pressure and puts you at higher risk for heart attack and stroke. If you do not smoke, don't start. If you do smoke, talk to yourprovider for help in finding the best way for you to quit. Managing stress. Learning how to relax and manage stress can improve your emotional and physical health and lower high blood pressure. Stress management techniques include exercising, listening to music, focusing on something calm or peaceful, and meditating. Getting enough high-quality sleep.   If you already have high blood pressure, it is important to prevent it from getting worse or causing complications. You need to get regular medical care and follow your treatment plan. Your plan will include healthy lifestyle habit recommendations and possibly medicines.  NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "disease": "HPV",
    "summary": "What is HPV? Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of more than 200 related viruses. Some of them are spread through sexual contact. Most people have been exposed to HPV. Usually, your immune system controls HPV infections, and they go away on their own and don't cause any health problems, but some need treatment.  There are two categories of sexually transmitted HPV. They are called low-risk HPV and high-risk HPV. Sometimes high-risk HPV infections can stay at the cervix (the lower part of a woman's uterus) for many years. This can lead to cell changes. If these changes are not screened for and treated, they may get worse over time and become cancer.   Low-risk HPVM can cause warts on or around your genitals, anus, mouth, or throat.  High-risk HPV can cause various cancers:  Cervical cancer Anal cancer Oropharyngeal cancer, a type of head and neck cancer, also called throat cancer  Vulvar cancer Vaginal cancer Penile cancer   Who is at risk for HPV infections? HPV infections are very common. Nearly all sexually active people are infected with HPV soon after they become sexually active.    What are the symptoms of HPV infections? Some people get warts from certain low-risk HPV infections, but the other types (including the high-risk types) have no symptoms.   If a high-risk HPV infection lasts for many years and causes cell changes, you may have symptoms. You may also have symptoms if those cell changes develop into cancer. Which symptoms you have depends on which part of your body is affected.  How are HPV infections diagnosed? Health care providers can usually find out if you have warts by looking at them.   Nearly all cervical cancers are caused by a long-lasting infection with a high-risk type of HPV. Screening can prevent cancer by finding out if you need treatment for changes that might happen before cancer, called precancer.   Screening tests for HPV can include:  For women, there are cervical cancer screening tests that can find changes in the cervix that might lead to cancer. As part of the screening, women may have Pap tests (sometimes called a Pap smear),  HPV tests,  or both. HPV tests use a sample of cervical cells. Your provider may also suggest a colposcopy  to check for abnormal cells.   What are the treatments for HPV infections? An HPV infection itself cannot be treated. Because HPV causes cancer at other places in the body, testing for the HPV virus can be helpful to make other treatment decisions.   HPV infection. Talk to your provider about whether you need other tests and how often you should be checked to prevent cervical cancer.  Warts. There are medicines that you can apply to a wart. If they don't work, your provider could freeze, burn, or surgically remove them.  Cell changes caused by infection with high-risk HPV. Treatments may include medicines you apply to the affected area or various surgical procedures.    People who have HPV-related cancers usually get the same types of treatment as people who have cancers that HPV does not cause. An exception to this is for people who have certain oral and throat cancers. They may have different treatment options.   Can HPV infections be prevented? Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not completely eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading HPV. If you or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have anal, vaginal, or oral sex.   Vaccines can protect against several types of HPV, including genital warts and some that can cause cancer. The vaccines provide the most protection when people get them before exposure to the virus. This means that it is best for people to get them before they become sexually active.   Ask your child's provider about when to vaccinate your child against HPV. If you're over age 26 and haven't been vaccinated, talk with your provider about the possible benefits of vaccination.   NIH: National Cancer Institute",

    "disease": "Hyperglycemia",
    "summary": "What is blood glucose? Blood glucose, or blood sugar, is the main sugar found in your blood. It is your body's primary source of energy. It comes from the food you eat. Your body breaks down most of that food into glucose and releases it into your bloodstream. When your blood glucose goes up, it signals your pancreas to release insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to be used for energy.  For people with diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin, can't use it as well as it should, or both. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.  What is hyperglycemia? Hyperglycemia means high blood glucose. It most often affects people who have diabetes. When you have diabetes, your body doesn't make enough insulin or can't use it the right way. Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.    What causes hyperglycemia? A key part of managing diabetes is controlling your blood glucose levels. To do this, you need to follow a diabetes meal plan and get regular physical activity. You might also need to take diabetes medicines. You have to balance all of these to keep your blood glucose at the right levels. But if you eat too much food or the wrong foods, don't take your medicines correctly, or don't get physical activity, you can get hyperglycemia. It can also happen if you are stressed or sick.      Less commonly, people who don't have diabetes can also get hyperglycemia. It can be caused by conditions that can affect insulin or glucose levels in your blood. They include problems with your pancreas or adrenal glands, certain medicines, and severe illnesses.  What are the symptoms of hyperglycemia? The symptoms of hyperglycemia include:  Feeling thirsty Feeling tired or weak Headaches Urinating (peeing) often Blurred vision   If you are diabetic and you often have high blood glucose levels or the symptoms of hyperglycemia, talk with your health care team. You may need a change in your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, or diabetes medicines.  If you don't have diabetes and you are having these symptoms, see your provider to find out the cause and how to treat it.  What other problems can hyperglycemia cause? If hyperglycemia is not treated, it can cause other problems. In people with diabetes, long-term hyperglycemia can lead to serious health problems (diabetes complications).  If your blood glucose levels get very high, you can develop diabetes-related ketoacidosis (DKA). It happens when your body doesn't have enough insulin to allow blood glucose into your cells for use as energy. Instead, your liver breaks down fat for fuel. This process produces acids called ketones. When too many ketones are produced too fast, they can build up to dangerous levels in your body. This can be life-threatening.  The symptoms of DKA may include:  Trouble breathing Nausea or vomiting Pain in your abdomen (belly) Confusion Feeling very tired or sleepy   If you have an an at-home test for ketones, check your ketone level every 4 to 6 hours when your blood glucose is very high or when you are having these symptoms. If the test shows that your ketones are moderate or high, or if you don't have a ketones test, contact your health care provider right away or get emergency medical help.  How is hyperglycemia diagnosed? If you have diabetes, you'll most likely need to check your blood glucose every day and make sure that it's not too high. You can do this with a blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.   There are also blood tests that providers can use to check if your blood glucose is too high.  What are the treatments for hyperglycemia? If you have diabetes and often have high blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines.  If you have severe hyperglycemia and are having symptoms of DKA, you will need treatment at the hospital. The treatment often includes I.V. (intravenous) fluids and insulin.  Can hyperglycemia be prevented? If you have diabetes, managing your diabetes can help prevent hyperglycemia. To manage your diabetes, it's important to:  Follow your diabetes meal plan Get regular physical activity If you need diabetes medicines, take them correctly Regularly check your blood glucose level Get regular checkups with your health care team",

    "disease": "Hyperthyroidism",
    "summary": "What is hyperthyroidism?  Hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs.  Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods. If not treated, hyperthyroidism can cause serious problems with your heart, bones, muscles, menstrual cycle, and fertility. But there are treatments that can help.  What causes hyperthyroidism? Hyperthyroidism has several causes. They include: Graves' disease, an autoimmune disorder in which your immune system attacks your thyroid and causes it to make too much hormone. This is the most common cause. Thyroid nodules, which are growths on your thyroid. They are usually benign (not cancer). But they may become overactive and make too much thyroid hormone. Thyroid nodules are more common in older adults. Thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid. It causes stored thyroid hormone to leak out of your thyroid gland. Too much iodine. Iodine is found in some medicines, cough syrups, seaweed and seaweed-based supplements. Taking too much of them can cause your thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone. Too much thyroid medicine. This can happen if people who take thyroid hormone medicine for hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) take too much of it.   Who is at risk for hyperthyroidism? You are at higher risk for hyperthyroidism if you:  Are a woman Are older than age 60 Have been pregnant or had a baby within the past 6 months Have had thyroid surgery or a thyroid problem, such as goiter Have a family history of thyroid disease Have pernicious anemia, in which the body cannot make enough healthy red blood cells because it does not have enough vitamin B12 Have type 1 diabetes or primary adrenal insufficiency, a hormonal disorder Get too much iodine, from eating large amounts of foods containing iodine or using iodine-containing medicines or supplements   What are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism? The symptoms of hyperthyroidism can vary from person to person and may include: Nervousness or irritability Fatigue Muscle weakness Trouble tolerating heat Trouble sleeping Tremor, usually in your hands Rapid and irregular heartbeat Frequent bowel movements or diarrhea Weight loss Mood swings Goiter, an enlarged thyroid that may cause your neck to look swollen. Sometimes it can cause trouble with breathing or swallowing.   Adults over age 60 may have different symptoms than younger adults. For example, they may lose their appetite or withdraw from other people. Sometimes this can be mistaken for depression or dementia.  What other problems can hyperthyroidism cause? If hyperthyroidism isn't treated, it can cause some serious health problems, including: An irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots, stroke, heart failure, and other heart problems An eye disease called Graves' ophthalmopathy. It can cause double vision, light sensitivity, and eye pain. In rare cases, it can lead to vision loss. Thinning bones and osteoporosis Fertility problems in women Complications in pregnancy, such as premature birth, low birth weight, high blood pressure in pregnancy, and miscarriage   How is hyperthyroidism diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, including asking about symptoms A physical exam Thyroid tests, such as \t\t \t\t\tTSH, T3, T4, and thyroid antibody  blood tests \t\t\tImaging tests, such as a thyroid scan, ultrasound, or radioactive iodine uptake test.  A radioactive iodine uptake test measures how much radioactive iodine your thyroid takes up from your blood after you swallow a small amount of it. \t\t    What are the treatments for hyperthyroidism? The treatments for hyperthyroidism include medicines, radioiodine therapy, and thyroid surgery: Medicines for hyperthyroidism include \t\t \t\t\tAntithyroid medicines, which cause your thyroid to make less thyroid hormone. You probably need to take the medicines for 1 to 2 years. In some cases, you might need to take the medicines for several years. This is the simplest treatment, but it is often not a permanent cure. \t\t\tBeta blocker medicines, which can reduce symptoms such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. They work quickly and can help you feel better until other treatments take effect. \t\t  Radioiodine therapy is a common and effective treatment for hyperthyroidism. It involves taking radioactive iodine by mouth as a capsule or liquid. This slowly destroys the cells of the thyroid gland that produce thyroid hormone. It does not affect other body tissues. Almost everyone who has radioactive iodine treatment later develops hypothyroidism. This is because the thyroid hormone-producing cells have been destroyed. But hypothyroidism is easier to treat and causes fewer long-term health problems than hyperthyroidism. Surgery to remove part or most of the thyroid gland is done in rare cases. It might be an option for people with large goiters or pregnant women who cannot take antithyroid medicines. If you have all of your thyroid removed, you will need to take thyroid medicines for the rest of your life. Some people who have part of their thyroid removed also need to take medicines.   If you have hyperthyroidism, it's important not to get too much iodine. Talk to your health care provider about which foods, supplements, and medicines you need to avoid.

Too much glucose stays in your blood and doesn't reach your cells.  What is hypoglycemia? Hypoglycemia means low glucose. It happens when the level of glucose in your blood drops below what is healthy for you:  For many people with diabetes, this means a blood glucose level lower than 70 mg/dL. Your number might be different, so check with your health care team to find out what blood glucose level is too low for you. For people who don't have diabetes, hypoglycemia is typically a blood glucose level lower than 55 mg/dL.   What causes hypoglycemia? Hypoglycemia is common in people who have diabetes type 1 or who have diabetes type 2 and take insulin or other diabetes medicines. It can happen:  As a side effect of insulin or some other medicines that help your pancreas release insulin into your blood. These medicines can lower your blood glucose level.  If you don't eat or drink enough carbohydrates (carbs). Carbs are the main source of glucose for your body. If you get a lot more physical activity than usual. If you drink too much alcohol without enough food. When you are sick and can't eat enough food or keep food down.   Although it's rare, you can still get low blood glucose without having diabetes. The causes can include conditions such as liver disease, kidney disease, and hormone deficiencies (lack of certain hormones). It can also happen in people who have had certain types of weight loss surgery. Some medicines, such as certain heart medicines and antibiotics, can also cause it. See your health care provider to find out the cause of your low blood glucose and how to treat it.  What are the symptoms of hypoglycemia? The symptoms of low blood glucose tend to come on quickly. The symptoms can be different for everyone, but they may include:  Shaking Sweating Nervousness or anxiety Irritability or confusion Dizziness Hunger    How is hypoglycemia diagnosed? If you have diabetes, you'll most likely need to check your blood glucose every day and make sure that it's not too low. You can do this with a blood glucose meter or continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system.    There are also blood tests that providers can use to check if your blood glucose is too low.  If you don't have diabetes and you have hypoglycemia, your provider will likely order other tests to try to figure out the cause.  What are the treatments for hypoglycemia? If you have mild or moderate hypoglycemia, eating or drinking something with carbohydrates can help. But severe hypoglycemia can cause serious complications, including passing out, coma, or even death. Severe hypoglycemia can be treated with glucagon, a hormone that raises blood glucose levels. It can be given as nasal spray or injection. If you have diabetes, your provider can prescribe you a glucagon kit for use in case of an emergency.  If you have diabetes and you often have mild or moderate low blood glucose, your health care team may make changes to your diabetes meal plan, physical activity plan, and/or diabetes medicines.  If you don't have diabetes and you keep having low blood glucose, the treatment will depend on what is causing it to happen.  Can hypoglycemia be prevented? If you have diabetes and you take insulin or other medicines that lower blood glucose, you can help prevent hypoglycemia if you:  Follow your diabetes meal plan. Eat and drink enough carbs to keep your blood glucose in your target range. Also carry a source of fast-acting carbohydrate, such as glucose tablets or a juice box, with you in case your blood glucose gets too low. Be safe during physical activity. Check your blood glucose before and afterwards. You may need to eat a snack before your physical activity. If you take diabetes medicines, make sure to take them correctly.",

You can also get it from being cold and wet, or under cold water for too long. Babies and old people are especially at risk. Babies can get it from sleeping in a cold room.

    "disease": "Hypothyroidism",
    "summary": "What is hypothyroidism?  Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, happens when your thyroid gland doesn't make enough thyroid hormones to meet your body's needs. Your thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of your neck. It makes hormones that control the way the body uses energy. These hormones affect nearly every organ in your body and control many of your body's most important functions. For example, they affect your breathing, heart rate, weight, digestion, and moods. Without enough thyroid hormones, many of your body's functions slow down. But there are treatments that can help.  What causes hypothyroidism? Hypothyroidism has several causes. They include:  Hashimoto's disease, an autoimmune disorder where your immune system attacks your thyroid. This is the most common cause. Thyroiditis, inflammation of the thyroid Congenital hypothyroidism, hypothyroidism that is present at birth Surgical removal of part or all of the thyroid Radiation treatment of the thyroid Certain medicines In rare cases, a pituitary disease or too much or too little iodine in your diet    Who is at risk for hypothyroidism? You are at higher risk for hypothyroidism if you:  Are a woman Are older than age 60 Have had a thyroid problem before, such as a goiter Have had surgery to correct a thyroid problem Have received radiation treatment to the thyroid, neck, or chest Have a family history of thyroid disease Were pregnant or had a baby in the past 6 months Have Turner syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects females Have pernicious anemia, in which the body cannot make enough healthy red blood cells because it does not have enough vitamin B12 Have Sjogren's syndrome, a disease that causes dry eyes and mouth Have type 1 diabetes Have rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disease that affects the joints Have lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease    What are the symptoms of hypothyroidism? The symptoms of hypothyroidism can vary from person to person and may include:  Fatigue Weight gain A puffy face Trouble tolerating cold Joint and muscle pain Constipation Dry skin Dry, thinning hair Decreased sweating Heavy or irregular menstrual periods Fertility problems in women Depression Slowed heart rate Goiter, an enlarged thyroid that may cause your neck to look swollen. Sometimes it can cause trouble with breathing or swallowing.   Because hypothyroidism develops slowly, many people don't notice symptoms of the disease for months or even years.   What other problems can hypothyroidism cause? Hypothyroidism can contribute to high cholesterol. In rare cases, untreated hypothyroidism can cause myxedema coma. This is a condition in which your body's functions slow down to the point that it becomes life-threatening. During pregnancy, hypothyroidism can cause complications, such as premature birth, high blood pressure in pregnancy, and miscarriage. It can also slow the baby's growth and development.  How is hypothyroidism diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis:  A medical history, including asking about your symptoms A physical exam Thyroid tests, such as \t\t  \t\t\tTSH, T3, T4, and thyroid antibody  blood tests \t\t\tImaging tests, such as a thyroid scan, ultrasound, or radioactive iodine uptake test. A radioactive iodine uptake test measures how much radioactive iodine your thyroid takes up from your blood after you swallow a small amount of it. \t\t \t\t      What are the treatments for hypothyroidism? The treatment for hypothyroidism is medicine to replace the hormone that your own thyroid can no longer make. About 6 to 8 weeks after you start taking the medicine, you will get a blood test to check your thyroid hormone level. Your health care provider will adjust your dose if needed. Each time your dose is adjusted, you'll have another blood test. Once you find the right dose, you will probably get a blood test in 6 months. After that, you will need the test once a year. If you take your medicine according to the instructions, you usually should be able to control the hypothyroidism. You should never stop taking your medicine without talking with your health care provider first. If you have Hashimoto's disease or other types of autoimmune thyroid disorders, you may be sensitive to harmful side effects from iodine. Talk to your health care provider about which foods, supplements, and medicines you need to avoid. Women need more iodine when they are pregnant because the baby gets iodine from the mother's diet. If you are pregnant, talk with your health care provider about how much iodine you need.  NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

    "disease": "Hysterectomy",
    "summary": "What is a hysterectomy? A hysterectomy is surgery to remove the uterus (womb). The uterus is the place where a fetus grows during pregnancy. A hysterectomy treats problems like heavy bleeding, pain, or cancer in the uterus.  After a hysterectomy, you no longer have menstrual periods and can't become pregnant. Sometimes the surgery also removes the ovaries and fallopian tubes. If you have both ovaries taken out,menopause symptoms will usually begin.  What conditions does a hysterectomy treat? Hysterectomy is a major surgery. Your health care provider may suggest other treatment options first. These might include medicine, hormone therapy, or procedures to remove fibroids or stop heavy bleeding. Sometimes these won't help, or surgery might be the only option, depending on the condition that needs to be treated.  Your provider might recommend a hysterectomy if you have:  Fibroids, if you are near or past menopause, have large fibroids or very heavy bleeding. Endometriosis, that hasn't been cured by medicine or surgery. Uterine prolapse, which can happen after several vaginal births, menopause, or because of obesity. It is when the uterus drops into the vagina. Cancer, of the uterus, cervix, ovaries, or endometrium (the lining of the uterus). Vaginal bleeding, that is heavy or unusual and persists despite treatment. Chronic pelvic pain, which starts in the uterus. A hysterectomy is a last resort since it doesn't fix some pelvic pain. Adenomyosis, is a thickening of the walls of the uterus. A hysterectomy is only considered if pain is severe and no other treatments have worked.   What are the different types of hysterectomies? Your provider will discuss the type of hysterectomy you need, depending on your condition.   The different types of surgeries include:  A total hysterectomy is the most common type and involves the removal of all the uterus, including the cervix. The ovaries and fallopian tubes may or may not be removed.  A partial (subtotal or supracervical) hysterectomy removes just the upper part of the uterus. The cervix is left in place, and your ovaries may or may not be removed  A radical hysterectomy removes all the uterus, cervix, and tissue on both sides of the cervix and the upper part of the vagina. This is most often used to treat certain types of cancer, such as cervical cancer. The fallopian tubes and ovaries may or may not be removed.    What methods are used for a hysterectomy? A hysterectomy may be done several different ways. Your provider will determine the best method for the surgery based on your general health, the reason for the surgery, and other factors.   Methods to perform a hysterectomy include:  Abdominal hysterectomy. A cut is made in your lower abdomen (belly). Your provider may recommend this method if you have a large uterus or to check other pelvic organs for signs of disease. This surgery has a longer recovery time than the others. Vaginal hysterectomy. A small cut is made in your vagina. This may not be an option if you have very large fibroids.  Laparoscopic hysterectomy. Uses an instrument with a thin, lighted tube and an attached camera. This helps your provider see your pelvic organs. Small cuts are made in either your abdomen (belly) or vagina. This is not an option for all types of uterine fibroids. Robotic surgery. Your provider guides a robotic arm to do the surgery through small cuts in your lower abdomen (belly).    After a hysterectomy, it can take four to six weeks to recover, depending on the type of surgery you have.  What are the risks of a hysterectomy?  Like all surgeries, a hysterectomy has risks, even though the results are usually good. Talk to your provider about the benefits and risks of having a hysterectomy.   More serious risks can include:  Too much bleeding during surgery Infection Blood clots   Dept. of Health and Human Services Office on Women's Health",

    "disease": "Immune System and Disorders",
    "summary": "What is the immune system? Your immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs. Together they help the body fight infections and other diseases.  When germs such as bacteria or viruses invade your body, they attack and multiply. This is called an infection. The infection causes the disease that makes you sick. Your immune system protects you from the disease by fighting off the germs.  What are the parts of the immune system? The immune system has many different parts, including: Your skin, which can help prevent germs from getting into the body Mucous membranes, which are the moist, inner linings of some organs and body cavities. They make mucus and other substances which can trap and fight germs. White blood cells, which fight germs Organs and tissues of the lymph system, such as the thymus, spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes, lymph vessels, and bone marrow.  They produce, store, and carry white blood cells.   How does the immune system work? Your immune system defends your body against substances it sees as harmful or foreign. These substances are called antigens. They may be germs such as bacteria and viruses. They might be chemicals or toxins. They could also be cells that are damaged from things like cancer or sunburn.  When your immune system recognizes an antigen, it attacks it. This is called an immune response. Part of this response is to make antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that work to attack, weaken, and destroy antigens. Your body also makes other cells to fight the antigen.  Afterwards, your immune system remembers the antigen. If it sees the antigen again, it can recognize it. It will quickly send out the right antibodies, so in most cases, you don't get sick. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.  What are the types of immunity? There are three different types of immunity: Innate immunity is the protection that you are born with. It is your body's first line of defense. It includes barriers such as the skin and mucous membranes. They keep harmful substances from entering the body. It also includes some cells and chemicals which can attack foreign substances. Active immunity, also called adaptive immunity, develops when you are infected with or vaccinated against a foreign substance. Active immunity is usually long-lasting. For many diseases, it can last your entire life. Passive immunity happens when you receive antibodies to a disease instead of making them through your own immune system. For example, newborn babies have antibodies from their mothers. People can also get passive immunity through blood products that contain antibodies. This kind of immunity gives you protection right away. But it only lasts a few weeks or months.   What can go wrong with the immune system? Sometimes a person may have an immune response even though there is no real threat. This can lead to problems such as allergies, asthma, and autoimmune diseases. If you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy cells in your body by mistake.  Other immune system problems happen when your immune system does not work correctly. These problems include immunodeficiency diseases. If you have an immunodeficiency disease, you get sick more often. Your infections may last longer and can be more serious and harder to treat. They are often genetic disorders.  There are other diseases that can affect your immune system. For example, HIV is a virus that harms your immune system by destroying your white blood cells. If HIV is not treated, it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). People with AIDS have badly damaged immune systems. They get an increasing number of severe illnesses.",

Many of them are harmless, and some can even be helpful. But some of them can make you sick. Infectious diseases are diseases that are caused by germs.  What are the different types of germs that cause infectious diseases? There are four main types of germs:  Bacteria are one-celled germs that multiply quickly. They may give off toxins, which are harmful chemicals that can make you sick. Strep throat and urinary tract infections are common bacterial infections. Viruses are tiny capsules that contain genetic material. They invade your cells so that they can multiply. This can kill, damage, or change the cells and make you sick. Viral infections include HIV and the common cold. Fungi are primitive plant-like organisms such as mushrooms, mold, mildew, and yeasts. Athlete's foot and yeast infections are common fungal infections. Parasites are animals or plants that survive by living on or in other living things. Malaria and head lice are infections that are caused by parasites.   How can you get infectious diseases? There are many different ways that you can get an infectious disease, depending on the type of germ. They can include:  Through direct contact with a person who is sick. This includes kissing, touching, sneezing, coughing, and sexual contact. If you are pregnant, you can pass some germs to your fetus.  Through indirect contact, when you touch something that has germs on it. For example, you could get germs if someone who is sick touched a door handle, and then you touch it. Through insect or animal bites. Through contaminated food, water, soil, or plants.   What are the symptoms of infectious diseases? Infectious diseases can cause many different symptoms. Some are so mild that you may not even notice any symptoms, while others can be life-threatening.   What are the treatments for infectious diseases? There are treatments for some infectious diseases, such as antibiotic, antiviral, antifungal and anti-parasitic medicines. But for other infections, such as some caused by viruses, you can only treat your symptoms while you wait for your immune system to fight off the germ.    Can infectious diseases be prevented? You can take steps to help prevent many infectious diseases:  Get vaccinated. Wash your hands often. Pay attention to food safety. Avoid contact with wild animals. Use a latex condom every time you have sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.  Don't share items such as toothbrushes, combs, and straws.",

    "summary": "What is infectious mononucleosis (mono)? Infectious mononucleosis (mono) is a disease caused by viruses.The most common cause is the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Mono is contagious, which means it can spread from person to person. It is common among teenagers and young adults, especially college students.  What causes infectious mononucleosis (mono)? Mono can be caused by many different viruses. But it is most often caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is found all over the world. Most people get an EBV infection at some point in their lives, but only some of them will get the symptoms of mono. EBV infections often happen during childhood or when someone is a young adult. EBV infections in children usually do not cause symptoms. And when they do, it's hard to tell the difference between the symptoms of mono and the symptoms of other common childhood illnesses such as the flu. Teens and young adults who get EBV are more likely to have symptoms that are typical of mono.  EBV and the other viruses that cause mono are usually spread through body fluids, especially saliva (spit). This means that you can get it through kissing. That's why mono is sometimes called \"the kissing disease.\" But you can also get these viruses if you share food, drinks, forks, spoons, or lip balm with someone who has mono. Other less common ways of getting an infection are through blood transfusions, organ transplants, and blood and semen during sexual contact.  What are the symptoms of infectious mononucleosis (mono)? The symptoms of mono usually start four to six weeks after you get the infection. But they may start sooner in young children. The symptoms often develop slowly, and they may not all happen at the same time. They can include:  Extreme fatigue Fever Sore throat Head and body aches Swollen lymph glands in your neck and armpits Rash Swollen liver, spleen, or both (these are less common symptoms)   Most people get better in two to four weeks. However, some people may feel fatigued for several more weeks. Occasionally, the symptoms can last for six months or longer.  How is infectious mononucleosis (mono) diagnosed? Your healthcare provider may diagnose mono based on your symptoms and a physical exam. The exam will include checking to see if your lymph nodes, tonsils, liver, or spleen are swollen. In some cases, your provider might also order a mono test  to confirm the diagnosis.  What are the treatments for infectious mononucleosis (mono)?  Drinking plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration. Getting lots of rest. Taking over-the-counter medications for pain and fever. But don't give aspirin to children or teens because it may cause Reye syndrome. This syndrome is a rare, serious illness that can affect the brain and liver.   If you have severe symptoms, your provider may suggest additional treatment based on which organs in your body are affected by the mono.  Antibiotics don't treat viral infections, so they do not help with mono. Some people do get bacterial infections such as strep throat along with mono. In that case, you probably need antibiotics to treat the bacterial infection. But you should not take penicillin antibiotics like ampicillin or amoxicillin. Those antibiotics can cause a rash in people who have mono.  Mono can cause an enlarged spleen, which could rupture and cause a medical emergency. To try to protect the spleen, providers recommend avoiding intense exercise and contact sports until you fully recover (about a month).  Can infectious mononucleosis (mono) be prevented? There is no vaccine to protect against mono. To lower your chance of getting or spreading mono:  Don't share food, drinks, forks, spoons, or lip balm with anyone, especially if you or the other person has mono. Don't kiss someone if you or the other person has mono. Wash your hands often with soap and water.   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

    "summary": "What are inhalants?  Inhalants are substances that people inhale (breathe in) to get high. There are other substances that people might inhale, such as alcohol. But those are not called inhalants, because they can also be used another way. Inhalants are the substances that you can misuse only by inhaling them.  Using inhalants to try to get high, even once, can be very harmful to your brain and body. It can even lead to death.  What are the types of inhalants? Inhalants are often products that are easily bought and can be found in the home or workplace. They contain dangerous substances that have psychoactive (mind-altering) properties when they are inhaled. The four main types of inhalants are: Solvents, which are liquids that become gas at room temperature. They include paint thinner, nail polish remover, gasoline, and glue. Aerosol sprays, such as spray paint, deodorant spray, and vegetable oil sprays. Gases, including gas from lighters, whipped cream dispensers, and laughing gas. Nitrites, which  are similar to a prescription medicine for chest pain. They are sometimes called \"poppers.\" They are sold in small bottles and may be labeled as \"air freshener,\" \"leather cleaner,\" or \"liquid aroma.\" They are usually not used to alter someone's mood, but to improve their sexual function.   Some of the common slang terms for various inhalants include: Gluey Huff Laughing gas Rush Snappers Whippets/Whippits   How do people use inhalants? People who use inhalants breathe in the fumes through their nose or mouth, usually by \"sniffing,\" \"snorting,\" \"bagging,\" or \"huffing.\" It's called different names depending on the substance and equipment used.  The high that inhalants produce usually lasts just a few minutes, so people often try to make it last by inhaling them again and again over several hours.  Who uses inhalants? Inhalants are mostly used by young kids and teens. They often try inhalants before they try other substances because inhalants are easier to get.  What are the signs that someone is using inhalants? Signs that someone is using inhalants include: Chemical odors on breath or clothing Paint or other stains on face, hands, or clothes Hidden empty spray paint or solvent containers and chemical-soaked rags or clothing Red or runny eyes or nose Drunk or disoriented appearance Slurred speech Nausea or loss of appetite Inattentiveness, lack of coordination, irritability, and depression   What are the health effects of using inhalants? Most inhalants affect your central nervous system and slow down brain activity. Inhalants can cause both short-term and long-term health effects: Short-term health effects include:       Slurred or distorted speech   Lack of body control   Euphoria (feeling \"high\")    Dizziness   Hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't real)     Long-term health effects may include:      Liver and kidney damage   Loss of coordination   Spasms in your arms and legs   Delayed behavioral development   Brain damage       Using inhalants, even once, could lead to an overdose. This can cause you to have seizures or your heart to stop. It can also be deadly.  Are inhalants addictive? Addiction to inhalants is rare, but it can happen if you use them repeatedly. Stopping them can cause withdrawal symptoms, such as nausea, sweating, trouble sleeping, and mood changes.  Behavioral therapy may help people who are addicted to inhalants.  Can inhalant misuse be prevented? Kids and teens who use inhalants to get high are more likely to try other drugs and to have a substance use disorder (SUD) later in life. So it's important to try to prevent inhalant abuse. One thing that parents can do is talk to their children about inhalants. They can explain the dangers and give their children tips on how to deal with peer pressure if someone asks them to try inhalants.  NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse",

    "summary": "Inhalation injuries are acute injuries to your respiratory system and lungs. They can happen if you breathe in toxic substances, such as smoke (from fires), chemicals, particle pollution, and gases. Inhalation injuries can also be caused by extreme heat; these are a type of thermal injuries. Over half of deaths from fires are due to inhalation injuries.  Symptoms of inhalation injuries can depend on what you breathed in. But they often include: Coughing and phlegm A scratchy throat Irritated sinuses Shortness of breath Chest pain or tightness Headaches Stinging eyes A runny nose   If you have a chronic heart or lung problem, an inhalation injury can make it worse.  To make a diagnosis, your health care provider may use a scope to look at your airways and check for damage. Other possible tests include imaging tests of the lungs, blood tests, and lung function tests.  If you have an inhalation injury, your health care provider will make sure that your airway is not blocked. Treatment is with oxygen therapy, and in some cases, medicines. Some patients need to use a ventilator to breathe. Most people get better, but some people have permanent lung or breathing problems. Smokers and people who had a severe injury are at a greater risk of having permanent problems.  You can take steps to try to prevent inhalation injuries: At home, practice fire safety, which includes preventing fires and having a plan in case there is a fire If there is smoke from a wildfire nearby or lots of particulate pollution in the air, try to limit your time outdoors. Keep your indoor air as clean as possible, by keeping windows closed and using an air filter. If you have asthma, another lung disease, or heart disease, follow your health care provider's advice about your medicines and respiratory management plan. If you are working with chemicals or gases, handle them safely and use protective equipment",

Insomnia can be acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing). Acute insomnia is common. Common causes include stress at work, family pressures, or a traumatic event. It usually lasts for days or weeks.  Chronic insomnia lasts for a month or longer. Most cases of chronic insomnia are secondary. This means they are the symptom or side effect of some other problem, such as certain medical conditions, medicines, and other sleep disorders. Substances such as caffeine, tobacco, and alcohol can also be a cause.  Sometimes chronic insomnia is the primary problem. This means that it is not caused by something else. Its cause is not well understood, but long-lasting stress, emotional upset, travel and shift work can be factors. Primary insomnia usually lasts more than one month.  Who is at risk for insomnia? Insomnia is common. It affects women more often than men. You can get it at any age, but older adults are more likely to have it. You are also at higher risk of insomnia if you: Have a lot of stress Are depressed or have other emotional distress, such as divorce or death of a spouse Have a lower income Work at night or have frequent major shifts in your work hours Travel long distances with time changes Have an inactive lifestyle Are African American; research shows that African Americans take longer to fall asleep, don't sleep as well, and have more sleep-related breathing problems than Whites.

    "disease": "Iron",
    "summary": "What is iron? Iron is a mineral that our bodies need for growth and development. Your body uses iron to make hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. Hemoglobin carries oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. Iron is also important for healthy muscles, bone marrow, and organ function. Your body also needs iron to make some hormones.  How do you get iron? Iron is found naturally in many foods and is added to some fortified food products. Foods that are high in iron include:  Lean meat, seafood, and poultry Iron-fortified breakfast cereals and breads White beans, lentils, spinach, kidney beans, and peas Nuts and some dried fruits, such as raisins   Iron is available in supplements, either on its own or as part of many multivitamin/mineral supplements.  What causes low iron? Most people in the United States get enough iron. The amount that you need each day depends on your age, your sex, and whether you consume a mostly plant-based diet.  Sometimes people can have trouble getting enough iron. There can be many causes, including blood loss, a poor diet, or a problem absorbing enough iron from foods. Those who are more likely to have low iron include people who:  Have heavy periods Are pregnant or breastfeeding Are infants (especially if they were born premature or low birth weight) Are frequent blood donors Have cancer, certain digestive diseases, or heart failure Are on kidney dialysis Have trouble absorbing iron because they:      Have a digestive condition such as celiac disease, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, or Helicobacter pylori infection   Had weight loss surgery       What happens if you don't get enough iron? If you have too little iron, you may develop iron-deficiency anemia. It may not cause symptoms at first, but over time, it can cause fatigue, shortness of breath, and trouble with memory and concentration. Treatment for low iron and iron-deficiency anemia is usually with iron supplements.  What happens if you get too much iron? Too much iron can damage your body. For example, if you are healthy and take too many iron supplements, you may have symptoms such as constipation, nausea and vomiting, abdominal (belly) pain, and diarrhea. Higher iron levels can cause ulcers. Extremely high levels can lead to organ damage, coma, and death.  A disease called hemochromatosis can cause too much iron to build up in the body. Hemochromatosis is inherited (passed down through families). It is usually treated by removing blood (and iron) from your body on a regular basis.

    "summary": "What is an ischemic stroke? A stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.  There are two main types of strokes, ischemic and hemorrhagic. Ischemic stroke is the more common type. An ischemic stroke happens when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel in the brain. Quick treatment can save a life and improve the chances of recovery.    What causes an ischemic stroke? Ischemic strokes are usually caused by one or more of the following:  A blood clot. A clot can form in an artery that supplies the brain (thrombosis), or it can travel from another part of the body (embolism). Atherosclerosis. A disease in which plaque, a sticky substance made up of cholesterol, fat, and other substances, builds up inside your arteries. Irregular heart rhythms. Conditions like atrial fibrillation can cause clots to form in the heart, which may travel to the brain. Other heart and blood conditions. Such as heart valve diseases or sickle cell disease.   A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is caused by a brief blockage of blood flow to the brain. It usually lasts a few minutes. Having a TIA can mean you are at risk for having a more serious stroke.  What are the symptoms of ischemic stroke? Symptoms of stroke often happen suddenly. They include:  Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm or leg (especially on one side of the body) Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination Sudden severe headache with no known cause   If you think someone is having a stroke, the F.A.S.T. test can help you remember what to look for. Think \"FAST\" and look for:   Face drooping on one side when smiling. Arm weakness that occurs when the arms are raised, and one arm drifts downward. Speech is slurred or strange. Time to call 911.   How is an ischemic stroke diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider may do a physical exam, ask about your symptoms and medical history, and use imaging tests. Other heart tests may be done to help find the cause of the stroke.  How is an ischemic stroke treated? It is important to treat strokes as quickly as possible. The most common treatments include:  Medicines such as blood thinners or thrombolytics (which break up and dissolve existing clots) may be used to prevent or treat ischemic stroke.  Surgery or stenting may be used to open narrowed arteries or remove plaque build-up from the carotid arteries, which supply blood to the brain.   After treatment, rehabilitation can help you regain lost skills and independence. Your provider may also order other medicines to manage your blood pressure,cholesterol, or other health problems such as diabetes that may increase your risk for stroke.  Can an ischemic stroke be prevented? The best way to prevent stroke is by making heart-healthy lifestyle changes to lower your risk. If lifestyle changes aren't enough, your provider may prescribe medicine to help manage your risk factors.  NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",

Some may never go away completely. Some of the diseases that affect the joints include:    Arthritis. Arthritis may cause joint pain and swelling. There are many types of this disease. Osteoarthritis is the most common type. Over time, arthritis can cause severe joint damage. It can affect people of all ages. A joint injury when you're young may cause osteoarthritis later in life. Lupus. This autoimmune disease affects many parts of the body and can cause joint and muscle pain. Some types of lupus often cause arthritis. Sj\u00f6gren's Syndrome. This autoimmune disease affects glands that make moisture in many parts of the body. The main symptoms are dry eyes and mouth, but it often causes joint pain, too.   Treatments are different depending on the disease. But most treatments include medicines and therapies to relieve pain and other symptoms.  What types of joint disorders happen from sudden injuries?  Joint disorders from sudden injuries include:   Sprains and strains. Sprains are stretched or torn ligaments. Acute strains are stretched or torn muscles or tendons that happen from a sudden injury or movement, such as lifting a heavy object.  Dislocated joints. A joint is dislocated when the bones are pushed or pulled out of position. A joint dislocation is a medical emergency.    Treatment depends on the type of injury. You can treat many sports injuries at home. But you should call your health care provider if you:   Have a lot of joint pain, swelling or numbness Can't put weight on the joint Have pain from an old injury with more swelling, an unstable joint, or a joint that isn't normal in another way   What types of joint disorders happen from overuse? Overuse injuries usually damage the soft tissues of the joint. They can happen when you work a joint too hard by doing the same movements over and over. For example, you could get an overuse injury from playing a musical instrument, playing sports, or doing certain jobs, such as carpentry or painting.  Joint overuse injuries include:   Bursitis. The bursa is a small fluid-filled sac. It works as a pad between the bones of a joint and the moving parts around it, such as muscles, tendons and skin. With bursitis, the bursa becomes irritated and swollen with extra fluid. Overuse is the most common cause, but injuries, infections and other conditions, such as arthritis, can cause bursitis.  Tendinitis. This condition happens when you overuse a tendon. It swells and makes the joint painful to move.  Chronic strain. A strain becomes chronic when your muscles or tendons stretch or tear slowly over time from repeating the same movements.    The treatments for bursitis, tendinitis, and chronic strain are often the same. They usually include rest, keeping the injured joint higher than your heart, and taking medicine to reduce swelling. Your provider may recommend gentle exercise and other treatment. In some cases, your provider may suggest an injection (a shot) of medicine into the joint. If these do not help, you may need surgery.        How can I keep my joints healthy? Getting enough physical activity is one of the most important things you can do to prevent or slow joint disorders. Activity strengthens the muscles around your joints and helps them work better.  When you play sports, wear the right equipment to protect your joints, such as knee pads. If you already have joint problems, ask your provider what type of activities are best for you.

    "disease": "Juvenile Arthritis",
    "summary": "What is juvenile arthritis? Juvenile arthritis (JA) is arthritis that happens in children. It causes joint inflammation (swelling), pain, stiffness, and loss of motion. Joints are places where two bones meet, such as your elbow or knee. It can affect any joint, but it is more common in the knees, hands, and feet. JA can affect your child's growth and development, and in some cases, it can also affect other organs. Finding JA early and starting treatment can help manage symptoms and reduce joint damage.  Who is more likely to get juvenile arthritis? There are several other forms of arthritis affecting children. The most common type of JA in children under age 16 is juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). There are multiple types of JIA. Symptoms and the number of joints affected help determine the type. Some types of JIA are more common in girls.   What causes juvenile arthritis? The exact cause of JA is unknown. Most types are autoimmune disorders. This means that your immune system, which normally helps your body fight infection, attacks your body's tissues.   What are the symptoms of juvenile arthritis? Symptoms can vary depending on the type of JA. The symptoms of most types include joint pain, swelling, warmth, and stiffness. Your child may not complain of pain or stiffness, but one early sign of JA may be limping or clumsiness in the morning or after resting. Larger joints, such as the knee, may be swollen.  Certain types of JA can cause a high fever, swollen lymph nodes, a rash, growth problems, or eye inflammation in some children. Symptoms can come and go. Some children have just one or two flare-ups. Others have symptoms that never go away.   How is juvenile arthritis diagnosed? There is no single test for JA, so it can be hard to diagnose. Your health care provider may:  Ask about medical history and symptoms. Do a physical exam. Order blood tests or imaging studies.   What are the treatments for juvenile arthritis? A team of providers usually treats JA. Treatment will depend on your child's age, the type of JA, and how bad it is. Treatment can include medicines and physical therapy to help maintain movement and reduce swelling and pain.   NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases",

    "summary": "What is Kaposi sarcoma? Kaposi sarcoma, sometimes called KS, is a type of cancer. It causes lesions (abnormal tissue) to grow in different parts of the body, including:  The skin Lymph nodes Mucous membranes (the lining of the mouth, nose, and throat) Other organs   These lesions are usually red or purple. They are made of cancer cells, new blood vessels, and blood cells. The lesions may begin in more than one place in the body at the same time. This makes Kaposi sarcoma different from other cancers.  What causes Kaposi sarcoma and who is more likely to develop it? Kaposi sarcoma is caused by infection with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8). This virus is also called Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). Most people infected with this virus don't get Kaposi sarcoma. But certain people who get this virus are more likely to develop one of the types of Kaposi sarcoma:  People with weakened immune systems due to HIV can develop epidemic (HIV-associated) Kaposi sarcoma. People with weakened immune systems due to medicines they need to take after an organ transplant can develop iatrogenic (transplant-related) Kaposi sarcoma. Older men of Mediterranean or Eastern European Jewish heritage can develop classic Kaposi sarcoma. Young men in Africa can develop endemic (African) Kaposi sarcoma.   What are the symptoms of Kaposi sarcoma? Kaposi sarcoma usually starts out as one or more red, purple, or brown skin lesions on the legs and feet. They are most often on the ankles or soles of the feet. Over time, lesions may form in other parts of the body. The lesions may not cause symptoms. But sometimes the lesions can cause problems, especially as you get more of them and they grow bigger. For example:  Pressure from the lesions may block the flow of lymph and blood in the legs and cause painful swelling If lesions grow in your stomach or intestines, they can bleed and may cause abdominal (belly) pain and diarrhea Lesions in the lungs can also bleed and may cause shortness of breath   How is Kaposi sarcoma diagnosed? To find out whether you have Kaposi sarcoma, your health care provider:  Will ask about your medical and family history Will do a physical exam May order a chest x-ray to look for Kaposi sarcoma in the lungs May do a biopsy to check for Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the skin May do an endoscopy to check for Kaposi sarcoma in the stomach and intestines May do a bronchoscopy to check for Kaposi sarcoma in the lungs   If you do have Kaposi sarcoma, you will likely need blood and imaging tests to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.  What are the treatments for Kaposi sarcoma? Which treatment(s) you get will depend on  The type of Kaposi sarcoma you have How many lesions you have and where in the body they are What kinds of problems the lesions are causing Your overall health   For people who have epidemic (HIV-associated) Kaposi sarcoma, taking HIV medicines may be enough to treat the Kaposi sarcoma. For people who have iatrogenic (transplant-related) Kaposi sarcoma, changing the dose of the medicines or switching medicines may be helpful. But some people with these types of Kaposi sarcoma will need additional treatment.  The treatment options for Kaposi sarcoma may include:  Radiation therapy Surgery Cryosurgery, a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue Chemotherapy Immunotherapy   NIH: National Cancer Institute",

    "summary": "What is Kawasaki disease? Kawasaki disease is a rare illness that usually affects small children. Other names for the disease are Kawasaki syndrome and mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. It is a type of vasculitis, which is inflammation of the blood vessels. Kawasaki disease is serious, but most children can fully recover if they are treated right away.  What causes Kawasaki disease? Kawasaki disease happens when the immune system injures the blood vessels by mistake. Researchers do not fully know why this happens. But when it does, the blood vessels become inflamed and can narrow or close off.  Genetics may play a role in Kawasaki disease. There may also be environmental factors, such as infections. It does not seem to be contagious. This means that it cannot be passed from one child to another.  Who is more likely to develop Kawasaki disease? Kawasaki disease usually affects children under the age of 5. But older children and adults can sometimes get it. It is more common in boys than girls. It can affect children of any race, but those with Asian or Pacific Islander descent are more likely to get it.  What are the symptoms of Kawasaki disease? The symptoms of Kawasaki disease may include: High fever lasting at least five days A rash, often on the back, chest, and groin Swollen hands and feet Redness of the lips, lining of the mouth, tongue, palms of the hand, and soles of the feet Pink eye (conjunctivitis) Swollen lymph nodes in the neck   Contact your child's health care provider if your child has a fever for 4 days, especially if they have any other symptoms of Kawasaki disease.  What other problems can Kawasaki disease cause? Sometimes Kawasaki disease can affect the walls of the coronary arteries. These arteries bring blood and oxygen to your heart. This can lead to: An aneurysm (bulging and thinning of the walls of the arteries). This can raise the risk of blood clots in the arteries. If the blood clots are not treated, they could lead to a heart attack or internal bleeding. Inflammation in the heart. Heart valve problems.   Kawasaki disease can also affect other parts of the body, including the brain and nervous system, the immune system, and the digestive system.  How is Kawasaki disease diagnosed? There is no specific test for Kawasaki disease. To find out if your child has Kawasaki disease, your child's provider:  Will do a physical exam, which includes looking at the signs and symptoms Will likely order blood and urine tests to rule out other diseases and check for signs of inflammation May order tests to check for damage to the heart, such as an echocardiogram and electrocardiogram (EKG)   What are the treatments for Kawasaki disease? Kawasaki disease is usually treated in the hospital with an intravenous (IV) dose of immunoglobulin (IVIG) antibodies. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight infections.   Aspirin may also be part of the treatment. But do not give your child aspirin unless the health care provider tells you to. Aspirin can cause Reye syndrome in children. This is a rare, serious illness that can affect the brain and liver.  Treatment usually works. But if it is not working well enough, the provider may also give your child other medicines to fight the inflammation. If the disease affects your child's heart, they might need additional medicines, surgery, or other medical procedures.",

KS can affect different stages of physical, language, and social development. It also usually causes infertility.  What causes Klinefelter syndrome (KS)? KS is not inherited. It's caused by a random error that happens when a sperm or egg is formed. This error causes a male to be born with an extra X chromosome.  Chromosomes are tiny \"packages\" in your cells that contain your genes. Genes carry information, called DNA, that controls what you look like and how your body works. Normally, you're born with a set of 46 chromosomes in each cell, two of which are the sex chromosomes. Females usually have two X chromosomes (XX), and males usually have one X and one Y (XY). In KS, the male usually has two X chromosomes and one Y (XXY).  In rare cases, a male could have XY in some cells and XXY in other cells. This is called mosaic Klinefelter syndrome. Males with mosaic Klinefelter syndrome may have fewer symptoms, depending on the number of XY cells they have in their bodies and where those cells are located.  What are the symptoms of Klinefelter syndrome (KS)? Some males with KS may have no symptoms or very mild symptoms. So they might not know that they have KS, or they might not get diagnosed with it right away. In other cases, the symptoms can be more severe.  Boys with KS may be taller than other boys their age, with more fat around the belly. After puberty, they may have:  Smaller testes and penis Breast growth (called gynecomastia) Less facial and body hair Reduced muscle tone Narrower shoulders and wider hips Weaker bones Decreased sexual interest Lower energy   Many of these symptoms happen because of low testosterone in the body. Testosterone is the main male sex hormone.  Boys with KS may also have learning or language problems. These problems may affect them socially, so they may be shy and quiet and can have trouble fitting in.  Most males with KS are infertile because they make little or no sperm.  How is Klinefelter syndrome (KS) diagnosed? A genetic test called a karyotype test can diagnose KS. This test can show if there are abnormal chromosomes, including if there is an extra X chromosome.  What are the treatments for Klinefelter syndrome (KS)? There is no cure for KS, but treatments are available. The sooner the treatment is started, the better.  If treatment is started by early puberty, it will likely help in reducing the symptoms.  Treatments for KS may include:  Testosterone replacement therapy Surgery to remove or reduce breasts Physical, speech, behavioral, and occupational therapy   In some cases, fertility treatments may help men with KS father children.

    "summary": "What is knee replacement surgery? Knee replacement surgery is a surgery to replace parts of your knee joint with new, artificial parts. You may need a knee replacement if you have knee damage that causes severe pain and difficulty doing daily activities, such as walking and climbing stairs. It is usually done when other treatments for knee pain haven't helped enough. The goal of a knee replacement is to relieve pain and help you move better.  People of all ages may have knee replacement surgery. But it is more common in older people. The decision whether to have surgery is based on your overall health and how much your knee bothers you.   What conditions does knee replacement surgery treat? Knee replacement surgery treats conditions that cause the cartilage of the knee joint to wear away. These include:  Knee osteoarthritis. This is the most common reason for knee replacement surgery. It usually develops over time after an injury or with aging.  Knee damage from other types of arthritis. Problems from knee joints that aren't formed correctly.   What happens during knee replacement surgery? During the surgery, a surgeon removes damaged cartilage and some bone from the surfaces of your knee joint. Cartilage is tissue that covers your bones where they meet. Healthy cartilage is smooth and helps the bones glide over each other when you move. When cartilage becomes rough and wears away, the bones rub against each other, causing pain.  After removing the damaged knee cartilage and bone, the surgeon attaches the artificial parts to your bones. The artificial parts are made of metal and plastic. They will give your knee new, smooth surfaces.  Knee replacement surgery may replace all the damaged parts of your knee (total knee replacement) or just part of your knee (partial knee replacement). In a total knee replacement, the surgeon replaces 3 surfaces:  The end of the shinbone The end of the thighbone The back of the kneecap   What happens after knee replacement surgery? Some people go home the same day they have surgery. Other people will stay in the hospital a few days. To help prevent blood clots, you'll most likely take blood thinners and wear special socks or coverings on your legs for a short time after surgery.  The success of your surgery depends a lot on what you do at home to help yourself recover. A physical therapist will teach you exercises to make your knee stronger and help it bend. It is important to do these exercises regularly. You may need to use a cane or walker for several weeks after the surgery. It will probably also be several weeks before you can drive. Your doctor will tell you when you can start driving again. Most people who follow their recovery instructions can get back to nearly all of their normal daily activities within 3 to 6 weeks after surgery.   What is life like after a knee replacement? After recovering from surgery, most people can move better with less pain than before surgery. But having an artificial knee is not the same as having a normal, healthy knee. You need to protect your new knee by:  Staying at a healthy weight. Getting regular physical activity. Not doing any high-impact activities, such as jogging, running, and jumping. Instead, you can try low-impact activities that are good for your knee, such as walking, biking, and swimming   What are the risks of knee replacement surgery? The chance of having problems after knee replacement surgery is low. But there are risks after any surgery. Possible problems after knee replacement surgery include:  Infection Blood clots Heart attack Stroke Nerve damage Scarring that limits how far you can bend your knee  Your age, general health, and how active you are can all affect your risk of having a problem after knee replacement surgery.   How long does a knee replacement last? A knee replacement doesn't last forever. After 15 to 20 years, the artificial knee parts may become loose or worn. If that happens, you may need another surgery on the same knee.  If you're thinking about having knee replacement surgery, talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits. Together you can decide if a knee replacement is right for you.",

    "disease": "LDL: The \"Bad\" Cholesterol",
    "summary": "What is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But having too much cholesterol in your blood raises your risk of coronary artery disease.   What are LDL and HDL? LDL and HDL are two types of lipoproteins. They are a combination of fat (lipid) and protein. The lipids need to be attached to the proteins so they can move through the blood. LDL and HDL have different purposes: LDL stands for low-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol because a high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. HDL stands for high-density lipoproteins. It is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol because it carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Your liver then removes the cholesterol from your body.     How can a high LDL level raise my risk of coronary artery disease and other diseases? If you have a high LDL level, this means that you have too much LDL cholesterol in your blood. This extra LDL, along with other substances, forms plaque. The plaque builds up in your arteries; this is a condition called atherosclerosis.   Coronary artery disease happens when the plaque buildup is in the arteries of your heart. It causes the arteries to become hardened and narrowed, which slows down or blocks the blood flow to your heart. Because your blood carries oxygen to your heart, this means that your heart may not be able to get enough oxygen. This can cause angina (chest pain), or if the blood flow is completely blocked, a heart attack.    How do I know what my LDL level is? A blood test can measure your cholesterol levels, including LDL. When and how often you should get this test depends on your age, risk factors, and family history. The general recommendations are:  For people who are age 19 or younger::  The first test should be between ages 9 to 11 Children should have the test again every 5 years Some children may have this test starting at age 2 if there is a family history of high blood cholesterol, heart attack, or stroke   For people who are age 20 or older::  Younger adults should have the test every 5 years Men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65 should have it every 1 to 2 years   For people who are older than 65:  They should have the test every year.   You may need to get your cholesterol checked more often if you have heart disease, diabetes, or a family history of high cholesterol.  What can affect my LDL level? Things that can affect your LDL level include: Diet. Saturated fat and cholesterol in the food you eat make your LDL level rise Weight. Being overweight tends to raise your LDL level, lower your HDL level, and increase your total cholesterol level  Physical Activity. A lack of physical activity can lead to weight gain, which can raise your LDL level Smoking. Cigarette smoking lowers your HDL cholesterol. Since HDL helps to remove LDL from your arteries, if you have less HDL, that can contribute to you having a higher LDL level. Age and Sex. As women and men get older, their cholesterol levels rise. Before the age of menopause, women have lower total cholesterol levels than men of the same age. After the age of menopause, women's LDL levels tend to rise. Genetics. Your genes partly determine how much cholesterol your body makes. High cholesterol can run in families. For example, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an inherited form of high blood cholesterol.   Medicines. Certain medicines, including steroids, some blood pressure medicines, and HIV medicines, can raise your LDL level. Other medical conditions. Diseases such as chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and HIV can cause a higher LDL level. Race or ethnicity. People from certain racial or ethnic groups may have an increased risk of high blood cholesterol. For example, African Americans typically have higher HDL and LDL cholesterol levels than White Americans. Asian Americans are more likely to have higher LDL levels than other groups.   What should my LDL level be? With LDL cholesterol, lower numbers are better, because a high LDL level can raise your risk for coronary artery disease and related problems. The general ranges for healthy adults are:                       LDL (Bad) Cholesterol Level         LDL Cholesterol Category                                 Less than 100 mg/dL         Optimal                       100-129 mg/dL         Near optimal/above optimal                       130-159 mg/dL         Borderline high                       160-189 mg/dL         High                       190 mg/dL and above         Very High                If you have coronary artery disease or are at high risk for it, your health care provider may have different goals for your LDL level.   How can I lower my LDL level? There are two main ways to lower your LDL cholesterol level: Heart-healthy lifestyle changes, which include:  Heart-healthy eating. A heart-healthy eating plan limits the amount of saturated and trans fats that you eat. Examples of eating plans that can lower your LDL level include the Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes diet and the DASH eating plan. Weight management. If you are overweight, losing weight can help lower your LDL level. Physical Activity. Everyone should get regular physical activity.  Drug Treatment. If lifestyle changes alone do not lower your LDL level enough, you may also need to take medicines. There are several types of cholesterol-lowering drugs available, including statins. The medicines work in different ways and can have different side effects. Talk to your provider about which one is right for you.  While you are taking medicines to lower your LDL level, you still should continue with the lifestyle changes.   Some people with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) may receive a treatment called lipoprotein apheresis. This treatment uses a filtering machine to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood. Then the machine returns the rest of the blood back to the person.  NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

They can cause problems with:  Understanding what people are saying Speaking Reading Writing Doing math Paying attention  Often, children have more than one kind of learning disability. They may also have another condition, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  This can make learning even more of a challenge. The sooner a learning disability is identified and addressed, the better a child is likely to perform in school.  What causes learning disabilities? Learning disabilities don't have anything to do with how smart your child is. They are caused by differences in the brain, and they affect the way the brain takes in and uses information. These differences are usually present at birth. But there are certain factors that can play a role in the development of a learning disability, including:  Genetics Environmental exposures, such as lead Using substances while pregnant   How are learning disabilities diagnosed? The earlier you can find and treat a learning disability, the better. Unfortunately, learning disabilities are usually not found until a child is in school. If you notice that your child is struggling, talk to your child's teacher or health care provider about having your child evaluated for a learning disability. The evaluation may include:  Doing a physical exam to check for a medical problem that might make learning more difficult. Asking about your family history. Test your child's intellectual and school performance.   What are the treatments for learning disabilities? The most common treatment for learning disabilities is special education. A teacher or other learning specialist can help your child learn skills by building on their strengths and finding ways to make up for their weaknesses. They may suggest ways you can help your child when they do homework. Instructors may try special teaching methods, make changes to the classroom, or use technologies that can assist your child's learning needs. Some children also get help from tutors or speech or language therapists.   A child with a learning disability may struggle with low self-esteem, frustration, and other problems. Mental health professionals can help your child understand these feelings, develop coping tools, and build healthy relationships.  If your child has another condition, such as ADHD, they will need treatment for that condition as well.  NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development",

    "disease": "Legionnaires' Disease",
    "summary": "What is Legionnaires' Disease?  Legionnaires' disease is a serious type of pneumonia caused by Legionella bacteria. The disease got its name when a group of people at an American Legion convention became ill with this type of pneumonia.  Legionella is found naturally in freshwater, such as lakes and rivers. It can also be found in soil. But people usually only get sick from it when if it grows and spreads in man-made water systems. These systems can include hot tubs, fountains, and the plumbing systems of large buildings, such as hotels or nursing homes.  Legionella can also cause Pontiac fever. This is a milder, flu-like illness that doesn't infect your lungs.  What causes Legionnaires' disease? You can get the infection by breathing in mist or small drops of water that contain the bacteria. The mist may come from hot tubs, showers, or large building air conditioning units.  You usually can't get infected by drinking water that contains the bacteria unless you aspirate it (accidentally breathe the water into your lungs). The bacteria don't spread from person to person. Disease outbreaks happen when many people are exposed to the same water source that contains the bacteria.  Who is more likely to develop Legionnaires' disease? Most healthy people who come in contact with the bacteria do not become sick. You are more likely to develop an infection if you:  Are over the age of 50 Are a current or former smoker Have a chronic (long-lasting) disease such as diabetes or kidney failure Have a chronic lung disease such as COPD or emphysema Have a weakened immune system due to a disease such as HIV or cancer or are taking medicines that suppress your immune system Live in a long-term care facility Have recently stayed in a hospital or had surgery requiring anesthesia   What are the symptoms of Legionnaires' disease?  The symptoms usually show up 2 to 14 days after you were exposed to Legionella bacteria. Most of the symptoms are similar to those of other types of pneumonia. But Legionnaires' disease may also cause gastrointestinal symptoms and mental changes.   The symptoms of Legionnaires' disease may include:  Cough High fever Chills Headache Chest pain Shortness of breath Fatigue Nausea and vomiting Diarrhea Confusion   What other problems can Legionnaires' disease cause? Legionnaires' disease can cause life-threatening complications such as respiratory failure, kidney failure, and sepsis.  About 1 out of every 10 people who get sick with Legionnaires' disease will die from complications of the illness.  How is Legionnaires' disease diagnosed? To find out if you have Legionnaires' disease, your health care provider will probably order a chest x-ray to see if you have pneumonia. If you do have it, lab tests such as a urine or sputum test can check for the Legionella bacteria. Your provider may also order a blood test to see if you have been exposed to the bacteria.  What are the treatments for Legionnaires' disease? If you have Legionnaires' disease, you will likely need care in a hospital. The treatment is with antibiotics. Most people will recover, especially if they were healthy when they got the disease. Getting treatment early can increase the chances of getting better.  Can Legionnaires' disease be prevented? You can lower your risk of getting Legionnaires' disease if you:  Clean all your water-related devices regularly. This could include portable humidifiers, water heaters, air conditioners, and nasal rinses. If you haven't used your faucets and showerheads for a week or more, flush them by letting the hot and cold faucets run for at least two minutes before use. Avoid exposure to water sources such as decorative foundations or hot tubs if you don't know how well they are maintained. Use windshield cleaner in your wiper fluid tank in your car instead of water. Ask about how well your buildings' water systems are maintained.   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

    "summary": "What is leukemia? Leukemia is a term for cancers of the blood cells. Leukemia starts in blood-forming tissues such as the bone marrow. Your bone marrow makes the cells which will develop into white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Each type of cell has a different job: White blood cells help your body fight infection Red blood cells deliver oxygen from your lungs to your tissues and organs Platelets help form clots to stop bleeding   When you have leukemia, your bone marrow makes large numbers of abnormal cells. This problem most often happens with white blood cells. These abnormal cells build up in your bone marrow and blood. They crowd out the healthy blood cells and make it hard for your cells and blood to do their work.  What are the types of leukemia? There are different types of leukemia. Which type of leukemia you have depends on the type of blood cell that becomes cancer and whether it grows quickly or slowly.  The type of blood cell could be: Lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell Myeloid cells, immature cells that become white blood cells, red blood cells, or platelets   The different types can grow quickly or slowly: Acute leukemia is fast growing. It usually gets worse quickly if it's not treated. Chronic leukemia is slow growing. It usually gets worse over a longer period of time.    The main types of leukemia are: Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), which is the most common type of cancer in children. It can also affect adults. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is more common in older adults but can also affect children Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), which is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults. It often occurs during or after middle age. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), which usually occurs in adults during or after middle age   What causes leukemia? Leukemia happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA) in bone marrow cells. The cause of these genetic changes is unknown.  Who is at risk for leukemia? For the specific types, there are different factors which can raise your risk of getting that type. Overall, your risk of leukemia goes up as you age. It is most common over age 60.  What are the symptoms of leukemia? Some of the symptoms of leukemia may include: Feeling tired Fever or night sweats Easy bruising or bleeding Weight loss or loss of appetite Petechiae, which are tiny red dots under the skin. They are caused by bleeding.   Other leukemia symptoms can be different from type to type. Chromic leukemia may not cause symptoms at first.  How is leukemia diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose leukemia: A physical exam A medical history Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) Bone marrow tests. There are two main types - bone marrow aspiration and bone marrow biopsy. Both tests involve removing a sample of bone marrow and bone. The samples are sent to a lab for testing. Genetic tests to look for gene and chromosome changes   Once the provider makes a diagnosis, there may be additional tests to see whether the cancer has spread. These include imaging tests and a lumbar puncture, which is a procedure to collect and test cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).  What are the treatments for leukemia? The treatments for leukemia depend on which type you have, how severe the leukemia is, your age, your overall health, and other factors. Some possible treatments might include: Chemotherapy Radiation therapy Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells   NIH: National Cancer Institute",

    "summary": "What are leukodystrophies? Leukodystrophies are a group of rare genetic disorders that affect the central nervous system (CNS). The CNS is made up of your brain and spinal cord.  Leukodystrophies damage the white matter of your CNS. The white matter includes: Nerve fibers, also called axons, which connect your nerve cells Myelin, a layer of proteins and fatty materials that covers and protects the nerve fibers. It also helps speed up signals between the nerve cells.    When the white matter is damaged, it can slow down or block the signals between nerve cells. This can cause many different symptoms, including trouble with movement, vision, hearing, and thinking.  There are over 50 types of leukodystrophies. Some types are present at birth, while others may not cause symptoms until a child becomes a toddler. A few types mainly affect adults. Most types get worse over time.   What causes leukodystrophies? Leukodystrophies are caused by genetic changes. These changes are usually inherited, meaning that they are passed from parent to child.  What are the symptoms of leukodystrophies? The symptoms of leukodystrophies depend on the type; they can include a gradual loss of: Muscle tone Balance and mobility Walking Speech Ability to eat Vision Hearing Behavior   There can also be other symptoms, such as: Learning disabilities Bladder issues Breathing problems Developmental disabilities Muscle control disorders Seizures   How are leukodystrophies diagnosed? Leukodystrophies can be hard to diagnose because there are so many different types which can have different symptoms.

    "summary": "What is Lewy body dementia (LBD)?  Lewy body dementia (LBD) is one of the most common types of dementia in older adults. Dementia is a loss of mental functions that is severe enough to affect your daily life and activities. These functions include: Memory Language skills Visual perception (your ability to make sense of what you see) Problem solving Trouble with everyday tasks The ability to focus and pay attention   What are the types of Lewy body dementia (LBD)? There are two types of LBD: dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia. Both types cause the same changes in the brain. And, over time, they can cause similar symptoms. The main difference is in when the cognitive (thinking) and movement symptoms start.  Dementia with Lewy bodies causes problems with thinking ability that seem similar to Alzheimer's disease. Later, it also causes other symptoms, such as movement symptoms, visual hallucinations, and certain sleep disorders. It also causes more trouble with mental activities than with memory.  Parkinson's disease dementia starts as a movement disorder. It first causes the symptoms of Parkinson's disease: slowed movement, muscle stiffness, tremor, and a shuffling walk. Later on, it causes dementia.   What causes Lewy body dementia (LBD)? LBD happens when Lewy bodies build up in parts of the brain that control memory, thinking, and movement.  Lewy bodies are abnormal deposits of a protein called alpha-synuclein. Researchers don't know exactly why these deposits form. But they do know that other diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, also involve a build-up of that protein.  Who is at risk for Lewy body dementia (LBD)? The biggest risk factor for LBD is age; most people who get it are over age 50. People who have a family history of LBD are also at higher risk.  What are the symptoms of Lewy body dementia (LBD)? LBD is a progressive disease. This means that the symptoms start slowly and get worse over time. The most common symptoms include changes in cognition, movement, sleep, and behavior: Dementia, which is a loss of mental functions that is severe enough to affect your daily life and activities Changes in concentration, attention, alertness, and wakefulness. These changes usually happen from day to day. But sometimes they can also happen throughout the same day. Visual hallucinations, which means seeing things that are not there Problems with movement and posture, including slowness of movement, difficulty walking, and muscle stiffness. These are called parkinsonian motor symptoms. REM sleep behavior disorder, a condition in which a person seems to act out dreams. It may include vivid dreaming, talking in one's sleep, violent movements, or falling out of bed. This may be the earliest symptom of LBD in some people. It can appear several years before any other LBD symptoms. Changes in behavior and mood, such as depression, anxiety, and apathy (a lack of interest in normal daily activities or events)   In the early stages of LBD, symptoms can be mild, and people can function fairly normally. As the disease gets worse, people with LBD need more help due to problems with thinking and movement. In the later stages of the disease, they often cannot care for themselves.  How is Lewy body dementia (LBD) diagnosed? There isn't one test that can diagnose LBD. It is important to see an experienced doctor to get a diagnosis. This would usually be a specialist such as a neurologist. The doctor will: Do a medical history, including taking a detailed account of the symptoms. The doctor will talk to both the patient and caregivers. Do physical and neurological exams Do tests to rule out other conditions that could cause similar symptoms. These could include blood tests and brain imaging tests. Do neuropsychological tests to evaluate memory and other cognitive functions   LBD can be hard to diagnose, because Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease cause similar symptoms. Scientists think that Lewy body disease might be related to these diseases, or that they sometimes happen together.   It's also important to know which type of LBD a person has, so the doctor can treat that type's particular symptoms. It also helps the doctor understand how the disease will affect the person over time. The doctor makes a diagnosis based on when certain symptoms start: If cognitive symptoms start within a year of movement problems, the diagnosis is dementia with Lewy bodies If cognitive problems start more than a year after the movement problems, the diagnosis is Parkinson's disease dementia   What are the treatments for Lewy body dementia (LBD)? There is no cure for LBD, but treatments can help with the symptoms: Medicines may help with some of the cognitive, movement, and psychiatric symptoms Physical therapy can help with movement problems Occupational therapy may help find ways to more easily do everyday activities Speech therapy may help with swallowing difficulties and trouble speaking loudly and clearly Mental health counseling can help people with LBD and their families learn how to manage difficult emotions and behaviors. It can also help them plan for the future. Music or art therapy may reduce anxiety and improve well-being   Support groups can also be helpful for people with LBD and their caregivers. Support groups can give emotional and social support. They are also a place where people can share tips about how to deal with day-to-day challenges.

    "summary": "Metabolism is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Food is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Chemicals in your digestive system (enzymes) break the food parts down into sugars and acids, your body's fuel. Your body can use this fuel right away, or it can store the energy in your body tissues. If you have a metabolic disorder, something goes wrong with this process.   Lipid metabolism disorders, such as Gaucher disease and Tay-Sachs disease, involve lipids. Lipids are fats or fat-like substances. They include oils, fatty acids, waxes, and cholesterol. If you have one of these disorders, you may not have enough enzymes to break down lipids. Or the enzymes may not work properly and your body can't convert the fats into energy. They cause a harmful amount of lipids to build up in your body. Over time, that can damage your cells and tissues, especially in the brain, peripheral nervous system, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. Many of these disorders can be very serious, or sometimes even fatal.  These disorders are inherited. Newborn babies get screened for some of them, using blood tests. If there is a family history of one of these disorders, parents can get genetic testing to see whether they carry the gene. Other genetic tests can tell whether the fetus has the disorder or carries the gene for the disorder.  Enzyme replacement therapies can help with a few of these disorders.

AIDS is the final stage of infection with HIV. It happens when the body's immune system is badly damaged because of the virus. Not everyone with HIV develops AIDS.  Are there treatments for HIV? There is no cure for HIV, but there are many medicines to treat both HIV infection  and the  health problems and infections (called opportunistic infections, or OIs) that come with it. The medicines allow people with HIV to have long, healthy lives.  How can I live a healthier life with HIV?   IIf you have HIV, you can help yourself by: Getting medical care as soon as you find out that you have HIV. You should find a health care provider who has experience in treating HIV. Taking your medicines every day. Letting your provider know if you get any new symptoms or health problems. Keeping up with your regular medical and dental care.This includes staying up to date with your recommended health screenings and vaccinations. Your provider can let you know which ones you need.  Managing stress and getting support, such as from support groups, therapists, and social service organizations Trying to live a healthy lifestyle, including:      Eating healthy foods.This can give your body the energy it needs to fight HIV and other infections. It can help you manage HIV symptoms and medicine side effects. It may also improve absorption of your HIV medicines.   Getting regular physical activity. This can strengthen your body and immune system. It may also reduce the risk of depression.   Getting enough sleep. Sleep is important for your physical strength and mental health.   Not smoking. People with HIV who smoke have a higher risk of developing conditions such as certain cancers and infections. Smoking can also interfere with your medicines. Talk to your provider if you need help quitting smoking.  Avoiding heavy drinking or taking illegal drugs. They can damage your liver, which means your HIV medicine may not work as well. They can also make it harder for your body to fight infections.  Protecting yourself from OIs. Talk to your provider about medicines and vaccines that prevent certain OIs. Also, be careful to avoid exposure to contaminated food and water.      It is also important to reduce the risk of spreading HIV to other people.

Blood pressure is the force of your blood pushing against the walls of your arteries. Each time your heart beats, it pumps out blood into the arteries. Your blood pressure is highest when your heart beats, pumping the blood. This is called systolic pressure. When your heart is at rest, between beats, your blood pressure falls. This is the diastolic pressure. Your blood pressure reading uses these two numbers. Usually they're written one above or before the other, such as 120/80. If your blood pressure reading is 90/60 or lower, you have low blood pressure.   Some people have low blood pressure all the time. They have no symptoms and their low readings are normal for them.

    "disease": "Lung Cancer",
    "summary": "What is lung cancer?  Lung cancer is cancer that forms in tissues of the lung, usually in the cells that line the air passages. It is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women. There are two main types: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. These two types grow differently and are treated differently. Non-small cell lung cancer is the more common type.   Who is more likely to develop lung cancer? Anyone can develop lung cancer, but certain factors raise your risk of getting it: Smoking. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women. The more years you smoke and the more cigarettes you smoke each day, the more your risk goes up.  Your risk is also greater if you smoke a lot and drink alcohol every day or take beta carotene supplements. If you have quit smoking, your risk will be lower than if you had kept smoking. But you will still have a higher risk than people who never smoked. Secondhand smoke, which is the combination of the smoke that comes from a cigarette and the smoke breathed out by a smoker. When you breathe in secondhand smoke, you are exposed to the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts. A family history of lung cancer. Being exposed to asbestos, arsenic, chromium, beryllium, nickel, soot, or tar in the workplace. Being exposed to radiation, for example from: \t \t\tRadiation therapy to the breast or chest \t\tRadon in the home or workplace \t\tCertain imaging tests such as CT scans \t  HIV infection. Your risk is higher if you have HIV. However, smoking rates are higher in people who have HIV, so it's not clear whether the increased risk is from the HIV infection or from smoking. Air pollution. Studies show that living in areas with higher levels of air pollution increases your risk of lung cancer.   What are the symptoms of lung cancer? Lung cancer may not cause any signs or symptoms until the cancer is advanced. Sometimes the cancer is found during a chest x-ray done for another condition.  The symptoms of lung cancer may include: Chest pain or discomfort A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time Coughing up blood Trouble breathing Wheezing Hoarseness Loss of appetite Weight loss for no known reason Feeling very tired Trouble swallowing Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck   How is lung cancer diagnosed? To find out if you have lung cancer, your health care provider: Will take your medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms Will ask about your family history Will do a physical exam May order certain imaging tests, such as a chest x-ray or chest CT scan May order lab tests, including tests of your blood and sputum May do a procedure to take a biopsy of the lung   If you do have lung cancer, your provider will do other tests to find out if it has spread through the lungs, lymph nodes, and the rest of the body. This is called staging. Knowing the type and stage of lung cancer you have helps your provider decide what kind of treatment you need.  If you have small-cell lung cancer, your provider may also do genetic testing to look for certain gene changes (variants) in your cancer cells. The results of the testing may help guide treatment.  What are the treatments for lung cancer? For most patients with lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer. Your treatment will depend on which type of lung cancer you have, how far it has spread, your overall health, and other factors. You may get more than one type of treatment. The treatments for small cell lung cancer may include: Surgery. Chemotherapy. Radiation therapy. Immunotherapy. Laser therapy, which uses a laser beam to kill cancer cells. Endoscopic stent placement. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. It may be used to put in a device called a stent. The stent helps to open an airway that has been blocked by abnormal tissue.  The treatments for non-small cell lung cancer may include: Surgery. Radiation therapy. Chemotherapy. Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells. Immunotherapy. Laser therapy. Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a medicine and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells. Cryosurgery, which uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue. Electrocautery, a treatment that uses a probe or needle heated by an electric current to destroy abnormal tissue.   Can lung cancer be prevented? Avoiding the risk factors may help prevent lung cancer. For example, you can: Quit smoking. And if you don't smoke, don't start. Lower your exposure to hazardous substances at work. Lower your exposure to radon. Radon tests can show whether your home has high levels of radon. You can buy a test kit yourself or hire a professional to do the test.

    "summary": "What is lupus? Lupus is a chronic (long-lasting) type of autoimmune disease.Autoimmune diseases happen when your immune system attacks healthy cells and tissues by mistake. This attack causes inflammation. It can also damage many parts of the body, including the joints, skin, kidneys, heart, lungs, and brain.  There are several types of lupus: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is the most common type. It can be mild or severe and can affect many parts of the body. Cutaneous lupus affects the skin. It causes a rash or sores, usually after your skin is exposed to sunlight. The two major types of cutaneous lupus are discoid lupus and subacute cutaneous lupus. Drug-induced lupus is caused by a reaction to some medicines. The symptoms may start 3 to 6 months after starting the medicine. The symptoms usually go away when you stop taking the medicine. Neonatal lupus, which is rare, affects newborns. It is caused by certain antibodies that are passed from the pregnant parent to the baby.   What causes lupus? The cause of lupus is unknown. Researchers are studying what might cause or trigger the disease, such as:  Genetics Environmental factors, such as viral infections, sunlight, certain medicines, and smoking Problems with the immune system   Who is more likely to get lupus? Anyone can get lupus, but women get it much more often than men.  Lupus is more common in African Americans than in White people. It is also more common in people of American Indian and Asian descent.  African American and Hispanic women are more likely to have severe forms of lupus.  What are the symptoms of lupus? Lupus can have many symptoms, and they differ from person to person. Some of the more common ones are:  Arthritis, causing painful and swollen joints and morning stiffness Fever Fatigue or feeling tired often Red rashes, most often on the face (also called the \"butterfly rash\") Chest pain when taking a deep breath Hair loss Pale or purple fingers or toes, from cold and stress (Raynaud phenomenon)  Sensitivity to the sun Swelling in legs or around eyes Mouth ulcers Swollen glands Headache and dizziness Confusion and memory problems   Symptoms may come and go. When you are having symptoms, it is called a flare.  Flares can range from mild to severe. New symptoms may appear at any time.  What other problems can lupus cause? Lupus causes inflammation throughout your body. This can cause problems in your organs, including:  Kidney damage (lupus nephritis). Heart problems, including inflammation in the heart (myocarditis), heart valves, or lining of the heart muscle (pericarditis). Inflammation of blood vessels (vasculitis). Blood clots Inflammation of the tissue that surrounds the lungs (pleurisy). This can make it painful to breathe.   Some people with lupus may be more likely to develop other conditions, such as coronary artery disease (CAD) and atherosclerosis.  How is lupus diagnosed? There is no specific test for lupus, and it's often mistaken for other diseases that cause similar symptoms. So it may take a while to get a diagnosis. To find out if you have lupus, your health care provider:   Will ask about your symptoms, medical history, and family health history Will do a complete physical exam May order blood tests, such as ANA (antinuclear antibody), antibodies, complete blood count, and complement  tests May order other tests, such as urine tests May do biopsies:      Skin biopsy (looking at skin samples under a microscope)   Kidney biopsy (looking at tissue from your kidney under a microscope)       What are the treatments for lupus? There is no cure for lupus, but medicines and lifestyle changes can help control it.  People with lupus often need to see different providers. You will most likely have a primary care provider and a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in diseases of the joints and muscles). Which other specialists you will depend on how lupus affects your body. For example, if lupus is damaging your heart or blood vessels, you would see a cardiologist (a doctor who specializes in heart diseases).  Your primary care provider should coordinate care between all of your other providers and treat other problems as they come up. You and your primary care provider will develop a treatment plan to fit your needs. You will both review the plan often to make sure that it is working. You should report new symptoms to your provider right away so that your treatment plan can be changed, if needed.    The goals of a treatment plan are to: Prevent flares Treat flares when they occur Reduce organ damage and other problems Improve your quality of life   Treatments may include drugs to: Reduce fever, swelling, and pain Reduce inflammation in your body Prevent or reduce flares Reduce or prevent damage to joints Suppress (lower) the activity of your immune system   Besides taking medicines for lupus, you may need to take medicines for problems that are related to lupus such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or infection.  Alternative and complementary therapies are therapies that are not part of standard treatments. Some people try alternative and complementary therapies to improve their lupus symptoms. But research has not clearly shown whether these treatments may help or treat lupus. Talk to your provider before trying any new treatments.  How can I cope with lupus? It is important to take an active role in your treatment. It helps to learn more about lupus - being able to spot the warning signs of a flare can help you prevent the flare or make the symptoms less severe.  It is also important to find ways to cope with the stress of having lupus. Exercising and finding ways to relax may make it easier for you to cope. A good support system can also help.

    "summary": "What is Lyme disease?  Lyme disease is a bacterial infection you get from the bite of an infected tick. At first, Lyme disease usually causes symptoms such as a rash, fever, headache, and fatigue.  But if it is not treated early, the infection can spread to your joints, heart, and nervous system. Prompt treatment can help you recover quickly.  What causes Lyme disease? Lyme disease is caused by bacteria. In the United States, this is usually a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi. It spreads to humans through the bite of an infected tick. The ticks that spread it are blacklegged ticks (or deer ticks). They are usually found in the: Northeast Mid-Atlantic Upper Midwest Pacific coast, especially northern California   These ticks can attach to any part of your body. But they are often found in hard-to-see areas such as your groin, armpits, and scalp. Usually, the tick must be attached to you for more than 24 hours to spread the bacterium to you.  Who is more likely to get Lyme disease? Most tick bites happen in the warmer months (April-September), when ticks are most active and people spend more time outdoors. But you can also get bitten during the rest of the year, especially if the temperatures are warmer than usual.  Most tick bites happen in the summer months when ticks are most active and people spend more time outdoors. But you can get bitten in the warmer months of early fall, or even late winter if temperatures are unusually high. And if there is a mild winter, ticks may come out earlier than usual.  What are the symptoms of Lyme disease? Early symptoms of Lyme disease start between 3 to 30 days after an infected tick bites you. The symptoms can include: A red rash called erythema migrans (EM). Most people with Lyme disease get this rash. It gets bigger over several days and may feel warm. It is usually not painful or itchy. As it starts to get better, parts of it may fade. Sometimes this makes the rash look like a \"bull's-eye.\" Fever Chills Headache Fatigue Muscle and joint aches Swollen lymph nodes (\"swollen glands\")  If the infection is not treated, it can spread to your joints, heart, and nervous system. The symptoms may include:  Severe headaches and neck stiffness. More EM rashes on other areas of your body. Facial palsy, which is a weakness in your facial muscles. It can cause drooping on one or both sides of your face. Arthritis with severe joint pain and swelling, especially in your knees and other large joints. Pain that comes and goes in your tendons, muscles, joints, and bones. Heart palpitations, which are feelings that your heart is skipping a beat, fluttering, pounding, or beating too hard or too fast. An irregular heart beat (Lyme carditis). Episodes of dizziness or shortness of breath. Inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. Nerve pain. Shooting pains, numbness, or tingling in the hands or feet.   How is Lyme disease diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will consider: Your symptoms How likely it is that you were exposed to infected blacklegged ticks How likely it is that you could have other illnesses that cause similar symptoms The results of any lab tests   Most Lyme disease tests check for antibodies made by the body in response to infection. These antibodies can take several weeks to develop. If you are tested right away, it may not show that you have Lyme disease, even if you have it. So you may need to have another test later.  What are the treatments for Lyme disease? Lyme disease is treated with antibiotics. The earlier you are treated, the better; it gives you the best chance of fully recovering quickly.   After treatment, some patients may still have pain, fatigue, or difficulty thinking that lasts more than 6 months. This is called post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS). Researchers don't know why some people have PTLDS. There is no proven treatment for PTLDS; long-term antibiotics have not been shown to help. However, there are ways to help with the symptoms of PTLDS. If you have been treated for Lyme disease and still feel unwell, contact your health care provider about how to manage your symptoms. Most people do get better with time. But it can take several months before you feel better.  Can Lyme disease be prevented? To prevent Lyme disease, you should lower your risk of getting a tick bite: Avoid areas where ticks live, such as grassy, brushy, or wooded areas. If you are hiking, walk in the center of the trail to avoid brush and grass. Use an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent when you go outdoors. They are evaluated to make sure they are safe and effective. Make sure that the repellant has one of these ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or para-menthane-diol. It is important to follow the instructions on the label. Treat your clothing and gear with a repellant containing 0.5% permethrin Wear light-colored protective clothing, so you can easily see any ticks that get on you Wear a long-sleeved shirt and long pants. Also tuck your shirt into your pants and your pant legs into your socks. Check yourself, your children, and your pets daily for ticks. Carefully remove any ticks you find.

This can happen if you don't get enough protein, carbohydrates, and fats, eat too much unhealthy food, or don't get the vitamins and minerals your body needs.  Malnutrition can affect people of all ages, but children, older adults, and people with chronic (long-term) health problems have a higher risk.  What are the types of malnutrition? Most people think of undernutrition with malnutrition. But malnutrition can refer to undernutrition, overnutrition, or an imbalance of nutrients.   Types of malnutrition include:  Protein-energy undernutrition, also called macronutrient undernutrition, happens when your body doesn't get enough protein or calories from food. Two serious forms of this are kwashiorkor and marasmus.  An imbalanced nutritional status occurs when you are not getting the right mix of nutrients. You may get enough calories, but not enough vitamins or minerals.  Vitamin deficiency diseases happen when your body doesn't get enough of certain vitamins. Without the right vitamins, your body cannot stay healthy and may develop specific diseases. For example, scurvy can develop from too little vitamin C, rickets from too little vitamin D, and anemia from too little iron or vitamin B12.  Failure to thrive occurs when children don't gain weight or grow as expected. This may be due to not getting enough food, trouble absorbing nutrients, or other health problems. Overnutrition can occur when your body gets too many calories or nutrients. This may lead to obesity or other health issues.   What causes malnutrition? Malnutrition may occur for many reasons, including:   An unbalanced diet that lacks variety or specific nutrients. Some medical issues, which could include malabsorption syndromes, dementia, eating disorders, depression, alcohol use disorder (AUD), or cancer. Problems with swallowing, digestion, or dental issues. Certain medicines that affect how food tastes and smells. Not being able to get food or cook due to things such as chronic illness, mobility issues, or low income.   Who is at risk for developing malnutrition? Malnutrition can affect anyone, but some people have a higher risk than others. This includes people who:  Don't have enough knowledge about nutrition Don't have access to a variety of food Are older adults or children Have a low income  Have a chronic (long-term) illness    What are the symptoms of malnutrition? The symptoms of malnutrition can vary. You may have no symptoms, but if you do, they may include:   Fatigue and weakness  Dizziness  Losing weight without trying  Low body weight  Slow growth or development in children  Frequent infections or slow healing  Dry skin or brittle hair and nails  Swelling in the legs, feet, or belly    How is malnutrition diagnosed? To check for malnutrition, your provider may:  Do a nutritional screening, which may include questions about weight loss, changes in your appetite, and your ability to eat.  Do a physical exam and order blood tests to check for signs that you don't have enough nutrients. Refer you to other providers that specialize in nutrition, such as a dietician.   What are the treatments for malnutrition?  Treatment for malnutrition may include improving your diet, replacing missing nutrients, and treating the underlying cause.   Can malnutrition be prevented?  To help prevent malnutrition, eat a healthy diet with many different foods. Talk with your provider if you are worried about your diet, weight loss, or your child's growth.",

    "summary": "What is a mammogram? A mammogram is an x-ray picture of the breast. Health care providers use mammograms to look for early signs of breast cancer that can't be felt during a breast exam. There are two types of mammograms: screening mammograms and diagnostic mammograms.  What is a screening mammogram? A screening mammogram is a mammogram usually done for women who have no signs or symptoms of breast cancer. Regular screening mammograms can help reduce the number of deaths from breast cancer among women ages 40 to 74. This is because they can find breast cancer early and treatment can start earlier, maybe before it has spread.  But screening mammograms can also have risks. They can sometimes find something that looks abnormal but isn't cancer. This leads to further testing and can cause you anxiety. Sometimes mammograms can miss cancer when it is there. It also exposes you to radiation. You should talk to your provider about the benefits and drawbacks of mammograms. Together, you can decide when to start and how often to have a mammogram.    What is a diagnostic mammogram? A diagnostic mammogram takes a little longer to do than a screening mammogram. It's done for people who have a lump or other signs or symptoms of breast cancer. The signs can include breast pain, thickening of the skin of the breast, nipple discharge, or a change in breast size or shape. But these signs can also be caused by a breast condition that is benign (not cancer). A diagnostic mammogram may also be used if you have breast implants or if there are other reasons it's difficult to view your breast tissue.    How is a mammogram done? When you have a mammogram, you stand in front of an x-ray machine. The person who takes the x-rays places your breast between two plastic plates. The plates press your breast and make it flat. This may be uncomfortable, but it helps get a clear picture.   You will get both breasts x-rayed from the front and from the side. Afterwards, a radiologist (a doctor with special training) will read the mammogram. The doctor will look at the x-ray for early signs of breast cancer or other problems. You will usually get the results within a few weeks, although it depends on the clinic or medical office that you went to. If your results are not normal, you should hear back earlier. Ask your provider when and how you will receive your results.   What happens if my mammogram is not normal? An abnormal (not normal) mammogram does not always mean that there is cancer. You will need to have additional mammograms, tests, or exams before your provider can tell for sure. You may also be referred to a breast specialist or a surgeon. But it does not necessarily mean you have cancer or need surgery. You would see one of these doctors because they are experts in diagnosing breast problems.",

Marijuana can cause both short-term and long-term effects.   Short term: While you are high, you may experience: Altered senses, such as seeing brighter colors Altered sense of time, such as minutes seeming like hours Changes in mood Problems with body movement Trouble with thinking, problem-solving, and memory Increased appetite   Long term: In the long term, marijuana can cause health problems, such as:  Problems with brain development. People who started using marijuana as teenagers may have trouble with thinking, memory, and learning. Coughing and breathing problems, if you smoke marijuana frequently Problems with child development during and after pregnancy, if a woman smokes marijuana while pregnant   Can you overdose on marijuana? It is possible to overdose on marijuana, if you take a very high dose. Symptoms of an overdose include anxiety, panic, and a rapid heartbeat. In rare cases, an overdose can cause paranoia and hallucinations. There are no reports of people dying from using just marijuana.  Is marijuana addictive? After using marijuana for a while, it is possible to get addicted to it. You are more likely to become addicted if you use marijuana every day or you started using it when you were a teenager. If you are addicted, you will have a strong need to take the drug. You may also need to smoke more and more of it to get the same high. When you try to quit, you may have mild withdrawal symptoms such as: Irritability Trouble sleeping Decreased appetite Anxiety Cravings   What is medical marijuana? The marijuana plant has chemicals that can help with some health problems. More states are making it legal to use the plant as medicine for certain medical conditions. But there isn't enough research to show that the whole plant works to treat or cure these conditions. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved the marijuana plant as a medicine. Marijuana is still illegal at the national level. However, there have been scientific studies of cannabinoids, the chemicals in marijuana. The two main cannabinoids that are of medical interest are THC and CBD. The FDA has approved two drugs that contain THC. These drugs treat nausea caused by chemotherapy and increase appetite in patients who have severe weight loss from AIDS. There is also a liquid drug that contains CBD. It treats two forms of severe childhood epilepsy. Scientists are doing more research with marijuana and its ingredients to treat many diseases and conditions.  NIH: National Institute on Drug Abuse",

A mastectomy may be the first treatment option for some types of breast cancer or done after chemotherapy for other types. If you are at a very high risk for breast cancer, sometimes a mastectomy may be done to reduce your risk.  What are the different types of mastectomies?  There are different types of mastectomies. Each differs in the amount of breast tissue and lymph nodes that are removed. Some types of breast surgery remove the breast skin and the nipple. Others may also remove nearby lymph nodes, which are part of your immune system and help protect your body from infection and disease.  Which surgery you have depends on the stage of cancer, the size of the tumor, the size of the breast, and whether the lymph nodes are involved.  Types of breast surgery include:  Total (simple) mastectomy is the removal of all the breast tissue and nipple of the breast that has cancer. Some lymph nodes under your arm may be removed and checked for cancer. Modified radical mastectomy is the removal of the breast that has cancer, including the nipple, areola (dark-colored skin around the nipple), skin over the breast, most of the lymph nodes under the arm, and often the lining over the chest muscles. Lumpectomy is breast-sparing surgery. The tumor and some normal breast tissue around it are removed, but not the breast itself. Some lymph nodes under your arm may be removed and checked for cancer. Part of the chest wall lining may also be removed if cancer is near it.   No matter which breast surgery you choose, you may also need other treatments. These could include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or targeted therapy.  You may choose to have breast reconstruction to rebuild your breast at the same time as the mastectomy, or it may be done later. Your health care provider may suggest waiting if radiation therapy is part of your treatment plan.   NIH: National Cancer Institute",

The drug labels for prescription medicines have a section on \"Pediatric Use.\" It says whether the medicine has been studied for its effects on children. It also tells you which age groups were studied. Some over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, like those that treat fever and pain, have been studied for effectiveness, safety, or dosing in children.

They usually have the bacteria but don't get sick. This is called being a \"carrier.\" But sometimes the bacteria can spread to other parts of the body and cause meningococcal disease. The bacteria can spread from person to person through saliva (spit). It usually happens through close or lengthy contact with a person who has it. Close contact can include things like kissing and coughing. You cannot catch the bacteria through casual contact with someone who has the disease. For example, you cannot get it by breathing air where that person has been.  Who is more likely to get meningococcal disease?  Anyone can get meningococcal disease, but you are more likely to get it if someone you live with has it. You are also more likely to get it if you have direct contact with the saliva of someone who has it (like through kissing). Also, certain groups of people are more likely to get the disease. They include:  Children younger than 1 year old. Teens and young adults ages 16 through 23 years old. Adults 65 years and older. People with medical conditions that weaken their immune system, including those with HIV and certain rare immune system diseases. People who either don't have a spleen or have a spleen that does not function well. People who take complement inhibitor. These are immunotherapy medicines that are given to people with certain rare conditions. People who live in crowded settings, such as college dorms or military barracks. People who travel to areas where the disease is more common, such as certain parts of sub-Saharan Africa.   What are the symptoms of meningococcal disease? There are different types of meningococcal disease. The most common types are meningitis and septicemia. Both types are very serious and can be deadly in a matter of hours.  Meningococcal meningitis is a meningococcal infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord. The most common symptoms include:  Fever Headache Stiff neck   It can also cause symptoms such as:  Nausea and vomiting Photophobia (your eyes being more sensitive to light) Confusion   It may be hard to notice these symptoms in newborns and babies. They can also have different symptoms. They may:  Be slow or inactive Be irritable Vomit Feed poorly Have a bulging of the soft spot of their skull   Meningococcal septicemia is a meningococcal infection of the bloodstream. It's also called meningococcemia. When someone has this disease, the bacteria enter the bloodstream and multiply. This damages the walls of the blood vessels and causes bleeding into the skin and organs. The symptoms may include:  Fever and chills Fatigue Vomiting Cold hands and feet Severe aches or pain in the muscles, joints, chest, or abdomen (belly) Rapid breathing Diarrhea A dark purple rash (in the later stages of the disease)   Because it is so serious, you need to seek immediate medical attention if you or your child develops the symptoms of meningococcal disease.   How is meningococcal disease diagnosed? The signs and symptoms of meningococcal disease are often similar to those of other illnesses. This can make it hard to diagnose.  If your (or your child's) health care provider thinks that you or your child could have meningococcal disease, they will order tests that take samples of blood and/or cerebrospinal fluid  (fluid near the spinal cord). They will send the samples to a lab for testing. The testing will include bacteria culture testing, which can identify the specific type of bacteria that is causing the infection. Knowing this can help the provider decide on the best treatment.  What are the treatments for meningococcal disease? Certain antibiotics can treat meningococcal disease. It is important that treatment is started as soon as possible. So if the provider thinks you have meningococcal disease, they will give you antibiotics right away (before the test results come back). People with serious disease may need additional treatments, such as:  Breathing support Medicines to treat low blood pressure Surgery to remove dead tissue Wound care for parts of the body with damaged skin   Some people with meningococcal disease will have long-term health problems and disabilities. These may include:  Loss of limb(s) Deafness Nervous system problems Brain damage   Even with treatment, 10 to 15 in 100 people will die from the disease.  Can meningococcal disease be prevented? The best way to prevent meningococcal disease is to get vaccinated. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends meningococcal vaccination for:  All preteens and teens Children at higher risk for meningococcal disease Adults at higher risk for meningococcal disease   If you are a close contact of a person with meningococcal disease, you will likely be given antibiotics to prevent you from getting sick. This is called \"prophylaxis.\"  Close contacts include people who are living together. They also include people who had direct contact with the saliva of a person who has the disease (such as from kissing). Although it's rare, you can get meningococcal disease more than once.

    "disease": "Menopause",
    "summary": "What is menopause? Menopause is the time in your life when you stop having your period and can no longer get pregnant. You have reached menopause when you have not had a period for 12 months.  The time leading up to menopause is called the menopausal transition, or perimenopause. This transition usually begins in when you are in your 40s, but sometimes it can start earlier. It can last for several years. The most common age for reaching menopause is between 45 and 55 years old.   What is early menopause? Early, or premature menopause happens when your ovaries stop making hormones and periods stop before age 40. This can happen on its own (with no known cause). It can also happen because of surgery to remove the ovaries or uterus. Medical treatments such as chemotherapy or hormone therapy to treat breast cancer may also cause early menopause.  A condition called primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) happens when your ovaries stop working normally before you are age 40. But this condition is different from early menopause. If you have POI, you may still have periods, even though they might not come regularly. And you might still be able to get pregnant.  What are the symptoms of menopause? During the menopausal transition, your ovaries start to make less of the estrogen and progesterone hormones. The changes in these hormones cause the symptoms of menopause, which can include:  A change in your periods; they may be:      Irregular, with more or less time in between periods.   Shorter or longer.   Lighter or heavier.     Hot flashes, a sudden warm feeling in your face, neck, and chest. They may cause you to sweat. If they happen at night and cause sweating, they are called night sweats. Trouble sleeping, such as trouble falling asleep or getting back to sleep when you wake up. Over time, a lack of sleep can lead to fatigue and memory problems. Vaginal dryness, which may cause pain or discomfort during sexual intercourse. Mood changes, which can make you feel moody, anxious, or more irritable. Bladder issues, such as urinary incontinence (loss of bladder control) and urinary tract infections (UTIs).   You may also have other physical changes which could put you at risk for certain diseases. For example, the loss of estrogen can:  Cause you to lose bone density. This can lead to osteoporosis, a condition that causes bones to become weak and break easily. Raise your cholesterol levels and increase your risk of heart disease and stroke.   What are the treatments for the symptoms of menopause? You may not need treatment for the symptoms of menopause. But if you do, there are several different types of treatments:  Lifestyle changes You may find that you can manage your symptoms with lifestyle changes. Here are some changes that might make you feel better:  If you have hot flashes, dress in layers that can be removed at the start of a hot flash. You may want to carry a portable fan to use when you get a hot flash. Avoid alcohol, spicy foods, and caffeine. They can make your menopause symptoms worse. If you smoke, try to quit, not only for hot flashes, but for your overall health. Try to maintain a healthy weight. Being overweight or having obesity can make hot flashes worse. Have good sleep habits. Keep your bedroom dark, quiet, and cool. Get regular exercise. It can help you sleep better, improve your mood, and help lower your risk for many age-related diseases. Lower stress, for example by using relaxation techniques such as meditation, deep breathing, and muscle relaxation exercises.    If lifestyle changes are not enough to improve your symptoms, you may want to contact your health care provider. They will talk to you about your symptoms, family and medical history, and preferences. They also can explain the risks and benefits of the treatments.  Non-hormone treatments There are various non-hormone treatments for menopause symptoms, such as:  Medicines for hot flashes, including certain antidepressants, a medicine just for hot flashes, an antiseizure medicine, and a blood pressure medicine. Some of these medicines may also help with sleep problems. Medicines for urinary incontinence. Medicines to treat or help prevent osteoporosis. Low-dose birth control pills for very heavy bleeding or periods that are close together. Water-based lubricants to treat vaginal dryness. Medicines for painful intercourse that is caused by vaginal changes from menopause. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of talk therapy, for trouble sleeping.   Hormone treatments Another treatment for menopause symptoms is menopausal hormone therapy (MHT). It may also be called hormone replacement therapy (HRT). This treatment is usually with estrogen or estrogen plus progestin (a type of progesterone that's made in a lab). MHT can be given in pills, skin patches, rings, implants, gels, or creams. It may be used to treat symptoms such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness and to help prevent osteoporosis.  Like all medicines, MHT has benefits and risks. Talk with your provider about whether it is safe for you. If you decide to take MHT, your provider may recommend taking the lowest dose that works for the shortest time needed.  Supplements, herbs, and \"natural\" hormone creams There are various products that are marketed for menopause symptoms. They include supplements, herbs, and over-the-counter \"natural\" hormone creams. There has been research on many of these products. So far, none of them has clearly been shown to be helpful. Also, there is little information on the long-term safety of these products. Some supplements can have harmful side effects or interact with medicines. Check with your provider before you take use any of them.",

You can have just one risk factor, but people often have several of them together. When you have at least three of them, it is called metabolic syndrome. These risk factors include: A large waistline, also called abdominal obesity or \"having an apple shape.\" Too much fat around the stomach is a greater risk factor for heart disease than too much fat in other parts of the body. Having a high triglyceride level. Triglycerides are a type of fat found in the blood. Having a low HDL cholesterol level. HDL is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol because it helps remove cholesterol from your arteries.  Having high blood pressure. If your blood pressure stays high over time, it can damage your heart and lead to other health problems. Having a high fasting blood sugar. Mildly high blood sugar may be an early sign of diabetes.  The more factors you have, the higher your risk for heart disease, diabetes, and stroke is.   What causes metabolic syndrome? Metabolic syndrome has several causes that act together: Overweight and obesity An inactive lifestyle Insulin resistance, a condition in which the body can't use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood sugar into your cells to give them energy. Insulin resistance can lead to high blood sugar levels. Age - your risk goes up as get older    Genetics - ethnicity and family history  People who have metabolic syndrome often also have excessive blood clotting and inflammation throughout the body. Researchers don't know whether these conditions cause metabolic syndrome or worsen it.  Who is at risk for metabolic syndrome? The most important risk factors for metabolic syndrome are: Abdominal obesity (a large waistline) An inactive lifestyle Insulin resistance  There are certain groups of people who have an increased risk of metabolic syndrome: Some racial and ethnic groups. Mexican Americans have the highest rate of metabolic syndrome, followed by White and Black people. People who have diabetes People who have a sibling or parent who has diabetes Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) People who take medicines that cause weight gain or changes in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugar levels   What are the symptoms of metabolic syndrome? Most of the metabolic risk factors have no obvious signs or symptoms, except for a large waistline.  How is metabolic syndrome diagnosed? Your health care provider will diagnose metabolic syndrome based on the results of a physical exam and blood tests. You must have at least three of the risk factors to be diagnosed with metabolic syndrome: A large waistline, which means a waist measurement of  \t\t \t\t\t35 inches or more for women \t\t\t40 inches or more for men \t\t  A high triglyceride level, which is 150 mg/dL or higher A low HDL cholesterol level, which is \t\t \t\t\tLess than 50 mg/dL for women \t\t\tLess than 40 mg/dL for men \t\t  High blood pressure, which is a reading of 130/85 mmHg or higher. A high fasting blood sugar, which is 100 mg/dL or higher   What are the treatments for metabolic syndrome? The most important treatment for metabolic syndrome is a heart-healthy lifestyle, which includes: A heart-healthy eating plan, which limits the amount of saturated and trans fats that you eat. It encourages you to choose a variety of nutritious foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats. Aiming for a healthy weight Managing stress Getting regular physical activity Quitting smoking (or not starting if you don't already smoke)  If making lifestyle changes is not enough, you may need to take medicines.

You may also have other symptoms, such as nausea and weakness. You may be sensitive to light and sound.  What causes migraines? Researchers believe that migraine has a genetic cause. There are also a number of factors that can trigger a migraine. These factors vary from person to person, and they include: Stress Anxiety Hormonal changes in women Bright or flashing lights Loud noises Strong smells Medicines Too much or not enough sleep Sudden changes in weather or environment Overexertion (too much physical activity) Tobacco Caffeine or caffeine withdrawal Skipped meals Medication overuse (taking medicine for migraines too often)   Some people have found that certain foods or ingredients can trigger headaches, especially when they are combined with other triggers. These foods and ingredients include:  Alcohol  Chocolate  Aged cheeses  Monosodium glutamate (MSG)  Some fruits and nuts  Fermented or pickled goods  Yeast  Cured or processed meats     Who is at risk for migraines? About 12% of Americans get migraines. They can affect anyone, but you are more likely to have them if you: Are a woman. Women are three times more likely than men to get migraines. Have a family history of migraines. Most people with migraines have family members who have migraines. Have other medical conditions, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder, sleep disorders, and epilepsy.  What are the symptoms of migraines? There are four different phases of migraines. You may not always go through every phase each time you have a migraine.: Prodome. This phase starts up to 24 hours before you get the migraine. You have early signs and symptoms, such as food cravings, unexplained mood changes, uncontrollable yawning, fluid retention, and increased urination. Aura. If you have this phase, you might see flashing or bright lights or zig-zag lines. You may have muscle weakness or feel like you are being touched or grabbed. An aura can happen just before or during a migraine. Headache. A migraine usually starts gradually and then becomes more severe. It typically causes throbbing or pulsing pain, which is often on one side of your head. But sometimes you can have a migraine without a headache. Other migraine symptoms may include    Increased sensitivity to light, noise, and odors  Nausea and vomiting  Worsened pain when you move, cough, or sneeze   Postdrome (following the headache). You may feel exhausted, weak, and confused after a migraine. This can last up to a day.   Migraines are more common in the morning; people often wake up with them. Some people have migraines at predictable times, such as before menstruation or on weekends following a stressful week of work.  How are migraines diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will: Take your medical history Ask about your symptoms Do a physical and neurological exam   An important part of diagnosing migraines is to rule out other medical conditions which could be causing the symptoms. So you may also have blood tests, an MRI or CT scan, or other tests.  How are migraines treated? There is no cure for migraines. Treatment focuses on relieving symptoms and preventing additional attacks.  There are different types of medicines to relieve symptoms. They include triptan drugs, ergotamine drugs, and pain relievers. The sooner you take the medicine, the more effective it is.  There are also other things you can do to feel better: Resting with your eyes closed in a quiet, darkened room Placing a cool cloth or ice pack on your forehead Drinking fluids   There are some lifestyle changes you can make to prevent migraines: Stress management strategies, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, and biofeedback, may reduce the number and severity of migraines. Biofeedback uses electronic devices to teach you to control certain body functions, such as your heartbeat, blood pressure, and muscle tension. Make a log of what seems to trigger your migraines. You can learn what you need to avoid, such as certain foods and medicines. It also help you figure out what you should do, such as establishing a consistent sleep schedule and eating regular meals.  Hormone therapy may help some women whose migraines seem to be linked to their menstrual cycle  If you have obesity, losing weight may also be helpful    If you have frequent or severe migraines, you may need to take medicines to prevent further attacks. Talk with your health care provider about which drug would be right for you.   Certain natural treatments, such as riboflavin (vitamin B2) and coenzyme Q10, may help prevent migraines. If your magnesium level is low, you can try taking magnesium. There is also an herb, butterbur, which some people take to prevent migraines. But butterbur may not be safe for long-term use.

They include iron, manganese, copper, iodine, zinc, cobalt, fluoride and selenium.   Most people get the amount of minerals they need by eating a wide variety of foods. In some cases, your doctor may recommend a mineral supplement. People who have certain health problems or take some medicines may need to get less of one of the minerals. For example, people with chronic kidney disease need to limit foods that are high in potassium.",

    "disease": "Miscarriage",
    "summary": "What is a miscarriage? A miscarriage is an unexpected loss of pregnancy before the 20th week. Most miscarriages happen very early in the pregnancy, often before a woman even knows she is pregnant.    What causes a miscarriage? A miscarriage can happen in any pregnancy. Most miscarriages occur because the fetus doesn't develop properly. This is often linked to a genetic problem with the fetus, such as an extra or missing chromosome.   In many cases, the cause of a miscarriage is unknown. Some possible factors that may increase the chance of a miscarriage can include:  Problems with the uterus or cervix  Chronic diseases, including polycystic ovary syndrome Genetic problems with the fetus Pregnancy after 35 years of age Smoking, drug or alcohol use Certain chronic (long-term) health conditions, such as uncontrolled diabetes Severe malnutrition   What are the signs of a miscarriage? The signs of a miscarriage may be different for everyone and can vary based on how far along you are in your pregnancy.   Signs of a miscarriage can include:  Vaginal spotting or bleeding with or without pain. Some women may have some spotting in early pregnancy and don't miscarry. To be sure, contact your provider right away if you have any bleeding. Dark-colored vaginal discharge.  A gush of fluid or tissue from your vagina. Cramping or pain in your abdomen (belly) or lower back.   Sometimes, it's hard to know what's normal during pregnancy. If something seems unusual or is worrying you, talk to your provider.  How is a miscarriage diagnosed? To check if you have had a miscarriage, your provider may do the following:   A pelvic exam to check your cervix. Blood tests to check things such as the amount of blood loss and confirm pregnancy. An ultrasound to check the fetus.   What is the treatment for a miscarriage? Treatment after a miscarriage often depends on when it occurs during the pregnancy. If you miscarry early in your pregnancy, you may not need any treatment. If you are 12 or more weeks pregnant, you may need a shot to prevent problems with the Rh factor in future pregnancies.   In some cases, tissue is left in the uterus. If you don't have any signs of infection, your provider may recommend waiting for the tissue to pass naturally. If you need treatment to remove the tissue, it can include:  Medicines A procedure called dilatation and curettage (D&amp;C) or vacuum aspiration    No matter when it occurs, losing a pregnancy can be difficult. Counseling may help you cope with your grief. Later, if you decide to try to get pregnant again, talk with your provider to understand any risks. Many women who have a miscarriage go on to have healthy pregnancies later.   Can a miscarriage be prevented? Miscarriage can affect anyone and often can't be prevented. Focus on taking good care of yourself and start prenatal care visits early in your pregnancy.  NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development",

    "disease": "Mitochondrial Diseases",
    "summary": "Metabolism is the process your body uses to make energy from the food you eat. Food is made up of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Chemicals in your digestive system (enzymes) break the food parts down into sugars and acids, your body's fuel. Your body can use this fuel right away, or it can store the energy in your body tissues. If you have a metabolic disorder, something goes wrong with this process.  Mitochondrial diseases are a group of metabolic disorders. Mitochondria are small structures that produce energy in almost all of your cells. They make it by combining oxygen with the fuel molecules (sugars and fats) that come from your food. When the mitochondria are defective, the cells do not have enough energy. The unused oxygen and fuel molecules build up in the cells and cause damage.  The symptoms of mitochondrial disease can vary. It depends on how many mitochondria are defective, and where they are in the body. Sometimes only one organ, tissue, or cell type is affected. But often the problem affects many of them. Muscle and nerve cells have especially high energy needs, so muscular and neurological problems are common. The diseases range from mild to severe. Some types can be fatal.  Genetic mutations cause these diseases. They usually happen before age 20, and some are more common in infants. There are no cures for these diseases, but treatments may help with symptoms and slow down the disease. They may include physical therapy, vitamins and supplements, special diets, and medicines.",

    "disease": "Mitral Valve Prolapse",
    "summary": "What is the mitral valve? The mitral valve is one of the four valves in your heart. Heart valves have flaps that open and close. The flaps make sure that blood flows in the right direction through your heart and to the rest of your body. When your heart beats, the flaps open to let blood through. Between heartbeats, they close to stop the blood from flowing backwards.  The mitral valve opens to let blood flow from your heart's upper left chamber to the lower left chamber. When the lower left chamber contracts (squeezes) to pump blood to your body, the mitral valve closes tightly to keep any blood from flowing backwards.    What is mitral valve prolapse (MVP)? Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) happens when the flaps of the mitral valve become floppy and don't close tightly. In some cases, blood may leak backwards through the valve to the chamber it came from. This is called backflow, or regurgitation. When there is a lot of mitral valve backflow, the heart can't push enough blood out to the body. But most people who have MVP don't have any backflow. In fact, MVP doesn't cause any health problems for most people who have it.  Who is more likely to develop mitral valve prolapse (MVP)? Anyone can have MVP. Most people who have it were born with it. MVP tends to run in families, but researchers don't know the exact cause.  You may be more likely to develop MVP if you:  Are older. The risk of MVP increases as aging affects the valve. Had rheumatic fever, a disease that can develop after a strep throat infection and cause damage to the heart valves.  Were born with a connective tissue disorder, such as Marfan syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Have Graves' disease, a type of thyroid condition. Have scoliosis (a side-to-side curve of the spine) or other problems with the bones of your body. Have some types of muscular dystrophy.  Mitral valve prolapse with backflow is most common in men and people who have high blood pressure.   What are the symptoms of mitral valve prolapse (MVP)? Most people who have MVP don't have any symptoms. But if it does cause symptoms, they may include:  Heart palpitations (feeling that your heart is fluttering, skipping beats, or beating too hard or too fast) Shortness of breath (feeling like you can't get enough air) A cough Fatigue, dizziness, or anxiety Migraines Chest pain   What other problems can mitral valve prolapse (MVP) cause? In rare cases, MVP can cause other problems. They're most often caused by backflow. They can include:  Arrhythmia, a problem with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat  Endocarditis, an infection in the lining of the heart and heart valves Heart failure    How is mitral valve prolapse (MVP) diagnosed? Health care providers often find MVP during routine health check-ups. If you have MVP, your provider may hear a clicking sound when listening to your heart with a stethoscope. If blood flows backwards through the valve, your heart may also make a whooshing sound called a heart murmur.  You may also need certain heart tests. The most useful test is an echocardiogram, or echo. This is a type of ultrasound that uses sound waves to make a moving picture of your heart.   What are the treatments for mitral valve prolapse (MVP)? Most people don't need any treatment for MVP. If you have symptoms with little or no backflow, you may only need medicine to relieve your discomfort. If the amount of backflow is significant, you may need treatment to prevent other heart problems from developing. Treatments may include:  Medicines to help your heart work better. Heart surgery to repair or replace a very abnormal mitral valve with backflow. The goal of surgery is to improve your symptoms and reduce your risk of developing heart failure.  When possible, valve repair is generally preferred over replacement. That's because repairs are less likely to weaken the heart muscle, and they're less likely to cause heart infection.   Can mitral valve prolapse be prevented? You can't prevent mitral valve prolapse. But if you have mitral valve prolapse, you can help prevent the rare but serious problems it can cause by:   Brushing and flossing your teeth regularly. That helps keep bacteria out of your bloodstream, which further reduces the rare risk of a heart infection. Asking your provider if you need to take antibiotics before dental work or surgery to lower your risk of heart infection. This mostly applies to people who have had valve repair or replacement surgery.  Getting regular check-ups and taking any medicines that your provider may have prescribed. Making heart-healthy habits part of your life to prevent heart disease.   NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "disease": "Mosquito Bites",
    "summary": "Mosquitoes are insects that live all over the world. There are thousands of different species of mosquitoes; about 200 of those live in the United States.    Female mosquitoes bite animals and humans and drink a very small amount of their blood. They need protein and iron from blood to produce eggs. After drinking blood, they find some standing water and lay their eggs in it. The eggs hatch into larvae, then pupae, and then they become adult mosquitos. The males live for about a week to ten days, and the females can live up to several weeks. Some female mosquitoes can hibernate in the winter, and they can live for months.  What health problems can mosquito bites cause? Most mosquito bites are harmless, but there are times when they can be dangerous. The ways that mosquito bites can affect humans include: Causing itchy bumps, as an immune system response to the mosquito's saliva. This is the most common reaction. The bumps usually go away after a day or two.  Causing allergic reactions, including blisters, large hives, and in rare cases, anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that affects the whole body. It is a medical emergency. Spreading diseases to humans. Some of these diseases can be serious. Many of them do not have any treatments, and only a few have vaccines to prevent them. These diseases are more of a problem in Africa and other tropical areas of the world, but more of them are spreading to the United States. One factor is climate change, which makes the conditions in some parts of the United States more favorable to certain types of mosquitoes. Other reasons include increased trade with, and travel to, tropical and subtropical areas.   Which diseases can mosquitoes spread? Common diseases spread by mosquitoes include: Chikungunya, a viral infection that causes symptoms such as fever and severe joint pain. The symptoms usually last about a week, but for some, the joint pain may last for months. Most cases of chikungunya in the United States are in people who traveled to other countries. There have been a few cases where it has spread in the United States. Dengue, a viral infection that causes a high fever, headaches, joint and muscle pain, vomiting, and a rash. Most people get better within a few weeks. In some cases, it can become very severe, even life-threatening. Dengue is rare in the United States. Malaria, a parasitic disease that causes serious symptoms such as high fevers, shaking chills, and flu-like illness. It can be life-threatening, but there are drugs to treat it. Malaria is a major health problem in many tropical and subtropical areas of the world. Almost all cases of malaria in the United States are in people who traveled to other countries. West Nile Virus (WNV), a viral infection that often has no symptoms. In those that do have symptoms, they are usually mild, and include fever, headache, and nausea. In rare cases, the virus can enter the brain, and it can be life-threatening. WNV has spread across the continental United States. Zika Virus, a viral infection that often does not cause symptoms. One in five infected people do get symptoms, which are usually mild. They include a fever, rash, joint pain, and pink eye. Besides being spread by mosquitoes, Zika can spread from mother to baby during pregnancy and cause serious birth defects. It can also spread from one partner to another during sex. There have been a few outbreaks of Zika in the southern United States.   Can mosquito bites be prevented?  Use an insect repellent when you go outdoors. Choose an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent. They are evaluated to make sure they are safe and effective. Make sure that the repellant has one of these ingredients: DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or para-menthane-diol. It is important to follow the instructions on the label. Cover up. Wear long sleeves, long pants, and socks when outdoors. Mosquitoes may bite through thin fabric, so spray thin clothes with an EPA-registered repellent like permethrin. Don't apply permethrin directly to skin.  Mosquito-proof your home. Install or repair screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out. Use air conditioning if you have it. Get rid of mosquito breeding sites. Regularly empty standing water from your house and yard. The water could be in flowerpots, gutters, buckets, pool covers, pet water dishes, discarded tires, or birdbaths. If you plan to travel, get information about the areas you will be going to. Find out whether there is a risk of diseases from mosquitoes, and if so, whether there is a vaccine or medicine to prevent those diseases. See a health care provider familiar with travel medicine, ideally 4 to 6 weeks before your trip.",

    "disease": "Mpox",
    "summary": "What is mpox?  Mpox, which used to be called monkeypox, is a disease caused by the monkeypox virus. This virus is in the same family of viruses as the  smallpox virus.  Mpox can be spread between animals and people, but it's mainly spread through close contact with someone who has it. It is found regularly in parts of Central, Eastern and West Africa. The virus that causes it has been found in small rodents, monkeys, and other mammals that live in these areas.   Some outbreaks of mpox have affected people in many countries around the world, including the United States.  What are the types of monkeypox viruses? There are two types of monkeypox viruses:  Clade I is regularly found in Central and Eastern Africa. It causes more severe illness and deaths than clade II.  Clade II is regularly found in West Africa. Infections from clade II are less severe. Most people who get this type will survive. This type is the cause of the global mpox outbreak that peaked in 2022 but has continued to decrease.   How does mpox spread? Mpox spreads in different ways:  Through close, personal contact with someone who has the virus:      Through direct contact with their rash, scabs, or body fluids   By breathing in the virus during prolonged, face-to-face contact    During intimate physical contact such as kissing, cuddling, hugging, massage or sex     During pregnancy, from the mother to the fetus. From touching items (such as clothes, bedding, or towels) that were used by someone who has the virus From infected animals:      By being scratched or bitten by the animal   By preparing or eating meat or using products from the animal       Someone who has mpox can spread it from the time their symptoms start until their rash has fully healed, all scabs have fallen off, and a fresh layer of skin has formed.  This usually takes 2-4 weeks.  Researchers have found that some people can spread mpox to others from 1 to 4 days before their symptoms appear. It is not known how often this happens.  What are the symptoms of mpox? The symptoms of mpox usually start within 3 weeks from the time you were exposed to the virus. The symptoms may include:  A rash with sores that can look like pimples or blisters. It could be on the face, inside the mouth, and on other parts of the body, like the hands, feet, chest, genitals, or anus. It goes through different stages, including scabs, before healing. This can take 2-4 weeks. Fever. Chills. Swollen lymph nodes (\"swollen glands\"). Exhaustion. Headache. Muscle aches and backache. Respiratory symptoms, such as a sore throat, nasal congestion, or cough.   You may have all or only a few symptoms:  You may get a rash first, followed by other symptoms  You may have flu-like symptoms and then develop a rash 1-4 days later You may only get a rash      How is mpox diagnosed? To find out if you have mpox, your health care provider:  Will ask about your symptoms and medical history. Will look at your rash. Will take a sample of tissue from one of the sores so it can be tested for the monkeypox virus. May do blood tests to check for monkeypox virus or for antibodies to the virus. Antibodies are proteins that your immune system makes to fight foreign substances such as viruses and bacteria.    What are the treatments for mpox? There are no treatments specifically for mpox, but many people get better on their own.   Since mpox and smallpox are similar, antiviral medicines that treat smallpox may also help treat mpox. Antiviral medicines may be recommended for people have severe mpox or are at risk of severe mpox, for example because they:  Have immune system, for example from HIV or other conditions Are pregnant Are children, especially those under age 1 Have certain active skin conditions that can cause widespread infection, such as eczema, impetigo, or psoriasis   If you have mpox, it is recommended that you stay home from the time you have symptoms until your mpox rash has healed and a new layer of skin has formed. It would be best to stay in a separate room from your family members and pets if you can.  Can mpox be prevented? JYNNEOS is a vaccine that can help prevent mpox (and smallpox). The vaccine is given in two doses 4 weeks apart. Getting both doses gives the best protection.  The vaccine is recommended for people who are at risk of mpox, for example because they:  Had or think they could've had exposure to someone with mpox Are a man who has sex with men, who in the last 6 months had:      One or more sexually transmitted infections (STIs)   More than one sexual partner   Sex at a commercial sex venue (like a sex club or bathhouse)   Sex at a large public event where people had spread mpox     Had a sex partner who is at risk of mpox Expect to be in any of these situations Are at risk of exposure at work, for example at a lab or healthcare facility Will be traveling to an area where there is an outbreak and, while there, will likely have sex:      With a new partner   At a commercial sex venue or large public event   In exchange for money or drugs       Check with your provider to see if the vaccine is recommended for you.  There are also other steps you can take to help prevent mpox:  Avoid close, skin-to-skin contact with the mpox rash. So, while a person is sick with mpox:      Do not touch their rash or scabs   Do not kiss, hug, cuddle, or have sex with them     Avoid contact with items that were used by someone who has mpox:         Do not touch the bedding, towels, or clothing of a person who has mpox   Do not share eating utensils or cups with them   If you or someone you live with has mpox, clean and disinfect your home     Wash your hands often with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, especially after contact with sick people.

No one knows the exact causes of multiple myeloma, but it is more common in older people and African Americans. It can run in families. Common symptoms may include: Bone pain, often in the back or ribs Fractures (broken bones) Weakness or fatigue Weight loss Frequent infections and fevers Feeling very thirsty Frequent urination   Doctors diagnose multiple myeloma using lab tests, imaging tests, and a bone marrow biopsy.  Your treatment depends on how advanced the disease is and whether you have symptoms.  If you have no symptoms, you may not need treatment right away. If you have symptoms, you may have chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation, radiation, or targeted therapy. Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.  NIH: National Cancer Institute",

Some people get muscle cramps, especially leg cramps, at night. They can be painful, and they may last a few seconds to several minutes.  You can have a cramp in any muscle, but they happen most often in the: Thighs Feet Hands Arms Abdomen Area along your ribcage   What causes muscle cramps? Causes of muscle cramps include: Straining or overusing a muscle. This is the most common cause. Compression of your nerves, from problems such as a spinal cord injury or a pinched nerve in the neck or back Dehydration Low levels of electrolytes such as magnesium, potassium, or calcium Not enough blood getting to your muscles Pregnancy Certain medicines Getting dialysis   Sometimes the cause of muscle cramps is unknown.  Who is at risk for muscle cramps? Anyone can get muscle cramps, but they are more common in some people: Older adults People who are overweight Athletes Pregnant women People with certain medical conditions, such as thyroid and nerve disorders   When do I need to see a health care provider for muscle cramps? Muscle cramps are usually harmless, and they go away after a few minutes. But you should contact your health care provider if the cramps: Are severe Happen frequently Don't get better with stretching and drinking enough fluids Last a long time Are accompanied by swelling, redness, or a feeling of warmth Are accompanied by muscle weakness   What are the treatments for muscle cramps? You usually don't need treatment for muscle cramps. You may be able to find some relief from cramps by: Stretching or gently massaging the muscle Applying heat when the muscle is tight and ice when the muscle is sore Getting more fluids if you are dehydrated   If another medical problem is causing the cramps, treating that problem will likely help. There are medicines that providers sometimes prescribe to prevent cramps, but they are not always effective and may cause side effects. Talk to your provider about the risks and benefits of medicines.  Can muscle cramps be prevented? To prevent muscle cramps, you can: Stretch your muscles, especially before exercising. If you often get leg cramps at night, stretch your leg muscles before bed. Drink plenty of liquids. If you do intense exercise or exercise in the heat, sports drinks can help you replace electrolytes.",

Over time, the weakness gets worse and can cause trouble walking and doing daily activities. Some types of MD can also affect other organs.  What are the types of muscular dystrophy (MD)? There are many different types of MD. Some of the more common types include:  Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is the most common childhood form. It is severe and affects boys more often than girls. The symptoms usually start between ages 3 and 6. Becker muscular dystrophy, which is similar to Duchenne but is less severe and gets worse more slowly. It often starts in the teenage years. Congenital muscular dystrophies, which are present at birth or before age 2. They can be mild or severe. Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, which often starts in the teenage years. At first, it affects the muscles of the face, shoulders, and upper arms.   Each of the types of MD can be different in many ways, such as:  Who is more likely to get them Which muscles they affect When they appear, such as in infancy, childhood, middle age, or later What the symptoms are How serious the symptoms are How quickly they get worse Whether they run in families Whether they affect other organs   Even within the same type of MD, people can have different symptoms.  What causes muscular dystrophy (MD)? MD is genetic, meaning that it caused by a change in one or more genes. Gene changes are also called gene variants or mutations. The gene changes in MD affect proteins that strengthen and protect muscles.   There are different gene changes that cause each type of MD. And sometimes people who have the same type of MD can  have different gene changes.  Muscular dystrophy can run in families, or you can be the first in your family to have a muscular dystrophy.  How is muscular dystrophy (MD) diagnosed? To find out if you or your child has MD, your health care provider may use:  A medical and family history A physical exam Blood and urine tests, including genetic tests and tests for certain enzymes that may be released by damaged muscles Muscle biopsies Electromyography and nerve conduction studies to find out if muscles are responding the right way to nerve signals Heart testing, such as an electrocardiogram (EKG), since some types of MD can cause heart problems Exercise tests to measure muscle strength and breathing and detect any increased rates of certain chemicals following exercise Imaging tests such as an MRI to look at muscle quality and bulk and measure fatty replacement of muscle tissue   What are the treatments for muscular dystrophy (MD)? There is no cure for muscular dystrophy. Treatment can help with the symptoms and prevent complications. It usually includes a combination of therapies, such as:  Physical therapy to help keep muscles flexible and strong Occupational therapy to relearn lost motor skills and learn ways to work around weakened muscles Respiratory care, such as breathing exercises, oxygen therapy, and ventilators Speech therapy to help with speech and swallowing problems Assistive devices, such as wheelchairs, splints and braces, and walkers Medicines to help delay damage to muscles or minimize the symptoms of MD Surgery to treat some of the conditions associated with MD, such as heart problems, scoliosis, and cataracts   NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",

    "summary": "What is myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)? Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is a serious, long-term illness that affects many body systems. Another name for it is chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). ME/CFS can often make you unable to do your usual activities. Sometimes you may not even be able to get out of bed.  What causes myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)? Researchers don't yet know what causes ME/CFS. There may be more than one potential cause. It is also possible that two or more triggers might work together to cause the illness.  Researchers are studying many possible causes, including:  Infections Immune system changes Physical or emotional stress Changes in the way cells in the body get their energy Genetics; the illness can sometimes run in families   Who is more likely to develop myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)? Anyone can get ME/CFS, but it is most common in people between 40 and 60 years old. Adult women are more likely to develop it than adult men.  What are the symptoms of myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)? The primary, or core, symptoms of ME/CFS are:  Not being able to do activities that you used to do before the illness, along with severe fatigue. The fatigue must last six months or longer, and it is not improved by rest. Post-exertional malaise (PEM), which means that your symptoms get worse after any physical or mental activity. Sleep problems.   Along with the primary symptoms, to be diagnosed with ME/CFS, you need to have one or both of these symptoms:  Problems with thinking and memory. Worsening of symptoms while standing or sitting upright. This is called orthostatic intolerance. It can cause you to feel lightheaded, dizzy, weak, or faint while standing or sitting up.   Some of the other symptoms that ME/CFS can cause include:  Pain, including muscle pain, joint pain, and headaches Sore throat Tender lymph nodes (glands) in the neck or armpits Digestive issues, like irritable bowel syndrome Chills and night sweats Allergies and sensitivities to foods, odors, chemicals, light, or noise   ME/CFS can be unpredictable. Your symptoms may come and go. They may change over time; sometimes they might get better, and other times they may get worse.  How is myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) diagnosed? ME/CFS can be difficult to diagnose. There is no specific test for ME/CFS, and other illnesses can cause similar symptoms. Your health care provider has to rule out other diseases before making a diagnosis of ME/CFS.  Your provider will do a thorough medical exam, which will include:  Asking about your medical history and your family's medical history. Asking about your current illness, including your symptoms.  Some questions they may ask could include how often you have symptoms, how bad they are, how long they have lasted, and how they affect your life. Thorough physical and mental status exams. Blood, urine, or other tests to check for other illnesses which could be causing your symptoms.   Your provider may also ask you to see a specialist to check for other conditions which can cause similar symptoms.  What are the treatments for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS)? There is no cure or approved treatment for ME/CFS, but you may be able to treat or manage some of your symptoms.  You, your family, and your provider should work together to decide on a plan. You should figure out which symptom causes you the most problems and try to treat that first. For example, if sleep problems affect you the most, you might first try using good sleep habits. If those do not help, you may need to take medicines or see a sleep specialist.  Strategies such as learning new ways to manage activity can also be helpful. You need to make sure that you do not \"push and crash.\" This can happen when you feel better, do too much, and then get worse again.  When you have ME/CFS, it can be hard to help develop a treatment plan. It can also be difficult to  try to take care of yourself.  So it's important that you have support from family members and friends.  There are also various resources and strategies that might be helpful to you, such as:  Getting counseling to help you cope with the illness and its impact on your life. Eating a healthy diet. Nutritional supplements, if your provider suggests them. Complementary therapies such as meditation, gentle massage, or relaxation therapy.   Make sure to talk to your provider before you try any new treatments. Some treatments that are promoted as cures for ME/CFS are unproven, often costly, and could be dangerous.

    "disease": "Myasthenia Gravis",
    "summary": "What is myasthenia gravis? Myasthenia gravis, sometimes called MG, is a chronic (long-lasting) disease that causes weakness in your voluntary muscles. The voluntary muscles are the ones that you can control. They include the muscles you use for:  Eye and eyelid movement Facial expressions Chewing Talking Swallowing Breathing Moving your arms and legs    You can also have weakness in other muscles. This weakness gets worse with activity, and better with rest.  Myasthenia gravis is a type of autoimmune disease. In autoimmune diseases, your immune system attacks the healthy cells of your organs and tissues by mistake.  What causes myasthenia gravis? Myasthenia gravis is caused by an error in how nerve signals are sent to muscles. These signals get blocked at the nerve-muscle junction. This junction is the place where the nerve endings connect with the muscles they control.  Normally, this is how the signals work:  The signals travel down a nerve that controls movement in the muscle The nerve endings release a substance called acetylcholine Acetylcholine binds to the muscle tissue at the nerve-muscle junction This causes the muscle to contract (move)   But in someone with myasthenia gravis, the body's own immune system makes antibodies that block the binding of acetylcholine to the muscle. This makes the muscles weaker.  The thymus gland, which is part of your immune system, may play a role in myasthenia gravis. Normally, your thymus gland is active and growing when you are a child. It makes white blood cells to fight infections. At puberty, it starts getting smaller and is replaced by fat. It is usually small by the time you are an adult. But in many adults with myasthenia gravis, the thymus gland stays large. And some people with myasthenia gravis can get thymomas, which are tumors of the thymus. The are usually benign (not cancer), but they can sometimes become cancerous.  Who is more likely to develop myasthenia gravis? Although myasthenia gravis can affect people of any age, it is most common in young adult women (under age 40) and older men (over age 60). It is usually not inherited (passed down in families).  Myasthenia gravis normally does not affect infants. But if you are pregnant and have myasthenia gravis it's possible to pass the antibodies to your fetus. The baby can then be born with neonatal myasthenia. This condition is usually temporary, and the symptoms typically go away within two to three months after birth.  What are the symptoms of myasthenia gravis? The symptoms of myasthenia gravis will depend on which muscles are affected. The symptoms often include:  Weakness of the eye muscles Drooping of one or both eyelids Blurred or double vision  Changes in facial expressions Trouble swallowing Shortness of breath Speech problems Weakness in the arms, hands, fingers, legs, and neck   Different people have different levels of muscle weakness. And the weakness can vary from day to day. Some days it might be mild, and other days it might be worse. Physical activity often makes the muscle weakness worse.  Some people with myasthenia gravis can get severe weakness that  affects the muscles that control breathing. This is called a myasthenic crisis, and it is a life-threatening emergency.  How is myasthenia gravis diagnosed? There are many other conditions that can cause muscle weakness, so myasthenia gravis can be hard to diagnose. To find out if you have myasthenia gravis, your health care provider:  Will ask about your medical history and symptoms Will do a physical exam, including a neurological exam Will likely order tests for myasthenia gravis, including:       Blood tests   Imaging tests   Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies        What are the treatments for myasthenia gravis? There is no cure for myasthenia gravis, but treatments that can improve muscle weakness and help with symptoms. They include:  Anticholinesterase medicines, which can improve nerve-to-muscle messages and make muscles stronger. Immunosuppressive medicines, which are medicines that decrease your body's immune system responses. They can lower your body's production of abnormal antibodies. Monoclonal antibodies, which can also help decrease your body's immune system responses. Plasmapheresis (plasma exchange) and intravenous immunoglobulin, which are procedures to remove abnormal antibodies from your blood. They are usually used in severe cases. They can help with symptoms for a few weeks or months. Thymectomy, surgery to remove the thymus gland. It can reduce the symptoms of myasthenia gravis, possibly by rebalancing the immune system.   Lifestyle changes may be helpful for some people. The changes could include regular gentle exercise, getting enough rest, and eating healthy foods.  Some people with myasthenia gravis go into remission. This means that they do not have symptoms. The remission is usually temporary, but sometimes it can be permanent.

They normally turn into working nerve cells. But in neuroblastoma, they form a tumor.  Neuroblastoma usually begins in the adrenal glands. You have two adrenal glands, one on top of each kidney. The adrenal glands make important hormones that help control heart rate, blood pressure, blood glucose (blood sugar), and the way the body reacts to stress. Neuroblastoma may also begin in the neck, chest or spinal cord.  What causes neuroblastoma? Neuroblastoma is caused by changes in your genes. Gene changes also called gene variants or mutations. In most cases, the cause of the mutation is unknown. In some other cases, the mutation is passed from the parent to the child.  What are the symptoms of neuroblastoma? Neuroblastoma often begins in early childhood. Sometimes it begins before a child is born.The most common symptoms are caused by the tumor pressing on nearby tissues as it grows or by cancer spreading to the bone.They include: A lump in the abdomen, neck, or chest Bulging eyes Dark circles around the eyes Bone pain Swollen stomach and trouble breathing in babies Painless, bluish lumps under the skin in babies Weakness or paralysis (loss of ability to move a body part)   How is neuroblastoma diagnosed? To diagnose neuroblastoma, your child's health care provider will do various tests and procedures, which may include: A medical history. A neurological exam. Imaging tests, such as x-rays, a CT scan, an ultrasound, an MRI, or an MIBG scan. In an MIBG scan, a small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein. It travels through the bloodstream and attaches itself to any neuroblastoma cells. A scanner detects the cells. Blood and urine tests. Biopsy, in which a sample of tissue is removed and examined under a microscope. Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, in which bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone are removed for testing.   What are the treatments for neuroblastoma? The treatments for neuroblastoma include: Observation, also called watchful waiting, is where the health care provider does not give any treatments until your child's signs or symptoms appear or change. Surgery Radiation therapy. Chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell rescue. Your child will get high doses of chemotherapy and radiation. This kills the cancer cells, but it also kills healthy cells. So your child will get a stem cell transplant, usually of his or her own cells collected earlier. This helps to replace the healthy cells that were lost. Iodine 131-MIBG therapy, a treatment with radioactive iodine. The radioactive iodine collects in neuroblastoma cells and kills them with the radiation that is given off. Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells.   NIH: National Cancer Institute",

    "summary": "Neurofibromatosis is a genetic disorder of the nervous system. It mainly affects how nerve cells form and grow. It causes tumors to grow on nerves.  You can get neurofibromatosis from your parents, or it can happen because of a mutation (change) in your genes.  Once you have it, you can pass it along to your children. Usually the tumors are benign, but sometimes they can become cancerous.  There are three types of neurofibromatosis: Type 1 (NF1) causes skin changes and deformed bones. It usually starts in childhood.  Sometimes the symptoms are present at birth. Type 2 (NF2) causes hearing loss, ringing in the ears, and poor balance. Symptoms often start in the teen years. Schwannomatosis causes intense pain. It is the rarest type.   Doctors diagnose the different types based on the symptoms. Genetic testing is also used to diagnose NF1 and NF2. There is no cure. Treatment can help control symptoms. Depending on the type of disease and how serious it is, treatment may include surgery to remove tumors, radiation therapy, and medicines.

    "disease": "Non-Drug Pain Management",
    "summary": "What is pain? Pain is a signal in your nervous system that something may be wrong. It is an unpleasant feeling, such as a prick, tingle, sting, burn, or ache. Each person feels pain differently, even if the reason for the pain is the same. Pain may be sharp or dull. It may come and go, or it may be constant. You may feel pain in one area of your body, such as your back, abdomen, chest, pelvis, or you may feel pain all over.  There are two types of pain:  Acute pain usually comes on suddenly, because of a disease, injury, or inflammation (irritation, redness, and/or swelling). It usually goes away when the cause is treated or healed, though sometimes it can turn into chronic pain. Chronic pain lasts for longer than three months or the time in which you should have healed. It can cause severe problems.   What are pain relievers? Pain relievers are medicines that reduce or relieve pain. There are many pain medicines, each with advantages and risks. Some are over-the-counter (OTC) medicines. Others are stronger medicines, which are available by prescription. The most powerful prescription pain relievers are opioids. They are very effective, but people who take them are at risk of addiction and overdose. Because of the side effects and risks of pain relievers, you may want to try non-drug treatments first. If you need to take medicines, doing some non-drug treatments may allow you to take a lower dose.  What are some non-drug treatments for pain? Many non-drug treatments can help with pain. It is important to check with your health care provider before trying any of them:  Acupuncture involves stimulating acupuncture points. These are specific points on your body. There are different acupuncture methods. The most common one involves inserting thin needles through the skin. Others include using pressure, electrical stimulation, and heat. Acupuncture is based on the belief that qi (vital energy) flows through the body along paths, called meridians. Practitioners believe that triggering the acupuncture points can rebalance the qi. Research suggests that acupuncture can help manage certain pain conditions. Biofeedback techniques use electronic devices to measure body functions such as breathing and heart rate. This teaches you to be more aware of your body functions so you can learn to control them. For example, a biofeedback device may show you measurements of your muscle tension. By watching how these measurements change, you can become more aware of when your muscles are tense and learn to relax them. Biofeedback may help to control pain, including chronic headaches and back pain. Electrical stimulation involves using a device to send a gentle electric current to your nerves or muscles. This can help treat pain by changing or blocking pain signals. Types include: \t \t\tTranscutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS) \t\tImplanted electric nerve stimulation \t\tDeep brain or spinal cord stimulation \t  Massage therapy is a treatment in which the soft tissues of the body are kneaded, rubbed, tapped, and stroked. Among other benefits, it may help people relax, and relieve stress and pain. Meditation is a mind-body practice in which you focus your attention on something, such as an object, word, phrase, or breathing. This helps you to minimize distracting or stressful thoughts or feelings. Physical therapy uses techniques such as heat, cold, exercise, massage, and manipulation. It can help to control pain, condition muscles and restore strength. Psychotherapy (talk therapy) uses methods such as discussion, listening, and counseling to treat mental and behavioral disorders. It can also help people who have pain, especially chronic pain, by: \t \t\tTeaching them coping skills to better deal with the stress that pain can cause \t\tAddressing negative thoughts and emotions that can make pain worse \t\tProviding them with support \t  Relaxation therapy can help reduce muscle tension and stress, lower blood pressure, and control pain. It may involve tensing and relaxing muscles throughout the body. It may be used with guided imagery (focusing the mind on positive images) and meditation. Surgery can sometimes be necessary to treat severe pain, especially when back problems or serious musculoskeletal injuries cause it. There are always risks to getting surgery, and it does not always work to treat pain. It is important to go through all the risks and benefits with your provider.",

Nutrients are substances in foods that our bodies need so they can function and grow. They include carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water.  Good nutrition is important, no matter what your age. It gives you energy and can help you control your weight. It may also help prevent some diseases, such as osteoporosis, high blood pressure, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers. But as you age, your body and life change, and so does what you need to stay healthy. For example, you may need fewer calories, but you still need to get enough nutrients. Some older adults need more protein.  What can make it harder for me to eat healthy as I age? Some changes that can happen as you age can make it harder for you to eat healthy. These include changes in your: Home life, such as suddenly living alone or having trouble getting around Health, which can make it harder for you to cook or feed yourself Medicines, which can change how food tastes, make your mouth dry, or take away your appetite Income, which means that you may not have as much money for food Sense of smell and taste Problems chewing or swallowing your food   How can I eat healthy as I age? To stay healthy as you age, you should: Eat foods that give you lots of nutrients without a lot of extra calories, such as \t\t \t\t\tFruits and vegetables (choose different types with bright colors) \t\t\tWhole grains, like oatmeal, whole-wheat bread, and brown rice \t\t\tFat-free or low-fat milk and cheese, or soy or rice milk that has added vitamin D and calcium \t\t\tSeafood, lean meats, poultry, and eggs \t\t\tBeans, nuts, and seeds \t\t \t\t Avoid empty calories. These are foods with lots of calories but few nutrients, such as chips, candy, baked goods, soda, and alcohol. Pick foods that are low in cholesterol and fat. You especially want to try to avoid saturated and trans fats. Saturated fats are usually fats that come from animals. Trans fats are processed fats in stick margarine and vegetable shortening. You may find them in some store-bought baked goods and fried foods at some fast-food restaurants. Drink enough liquids, so you don't get dehydrated. Some people lose their sense of thirst as they age. And certain medicines might make it even more important to have plenty of fluids. Be physically active. If you have started losing your appetite, exercising may help you to feel hungrier.   What can I do if I am having trouble eating healthy? Sometimes health issues or other problems can make it hard to eat healthy. Here are some tips that might help: If you are tired of eating alone, try organizing some potluck meals or cooking with a friend. You can also look into having some meals at a nearby senior center, community center, or religious facility. If you are having trouble chewing, see your dentist to check for problems If you are having trouble swallowing, try drinking plenty of liquids with your meal. If that does not help, check with your health care provider. A health condition or medicine could be causing the problem. If you're having trouble smelling and tasting your food, try adding color and texture to make your food more interesting If you aren't eating enough, add some healthy snacks throughout the day to help you get more nutrients and calories If an illness is making it harder for you to cook or feed yourself, check with your health care provider.

Both terms mean that your weight is greater than what's considered healthy for your height.   Body Mass Index (BMI) measures how much you weigh compared to how tall you are. An adult who has a BMI of 30 or more is considered to have obesity. Severe obesity is having a BMI of 40 or higher. Obesity increases your risk for many other diseases and health problems, especially if the extra body fat is carried around the waist.  What raises your risk of obesity? Obesity happens over time from taking in more calories (through food and drinks) than used up from physical activity and daily living. Your body stores the extra calories as fat. The right balance between calories and activity is different for everyone.   There are many different factors that can affect your body weight. Certain medicines or medical conditions may affect your weight. Other factors include your:  Genetic makeup Eating habits Sex Race or ethnicity Physical activity level   How is obesity diagnosed? To find out if you have obesity, your health care provider may:  Ask about your health history, which may include reviewing your weight history, weight-loss efforts, and how physically active you are.  Do a physical exam, which may include checking your height, weight, and vital signs, as well as listening to your heart and lungs. Order blood tests or other imaging tests, which may include checking any known health problems, as well as for other weight-related diseases and health conditions.  Calculate your BMI, to check your risk for certain diseases. The higher your BMI, the higher your risk. BMI does not distinguish between fat, muscle, and bone mass. It may also overestimate body fat in athletes or those with a muscular build, or underestimate body fat in older persons, or others who have lost muscle.  Check your waist size, since a large waistline, with more body fat around your abdomen (belly) rather than your hips, increases your risk for weight-related health problems.    What health problems can obesity cause? Having a larger body size can make your heart work harder, put extra pressure on your joints, and may increase your risk for many health conditions, including:  Type 2 diabetes.  Heart disease.  High blood pressure.  Stroke.  Metabolic syndrome. Osteoarthritis.  Sleep apnea. Pregnancy problems. Fertility problems. Some cancers.    If you have obesity, losing even 5 to 10% of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases. For example, that means losing 10 to 20 pounds if you weigh 200 pounds.  What are the treatments for obesity? Treatment plans for obesity may depend on your overall weight, other health conditions, and your willingness to participate in a weight-loss plan.   Your provider can tell you what a healthy weight is for you, help you set goals, and give you tips on how to lose weight. They may refer you to other providers that specialize in nutrition or weight loss to help you make realistic goals and provide support.   Possible treatments may include:    Dietary changes and exercise goals to help you learn how to adopt healthy nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle changes to lose weight safely and keep it off long term.   Counseling or support groups can give you encouragement and help you understand what's behind weight changes.   Weight-loss medicines to treat obesity.  Weight loss procedures or surgery if you have severe obesity or serious obesity-related health problems and have not been able to lose enough weight.

They interfere with your life, but you cannot control or stop them.  What causes obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)? The cause of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is unknown. Factors such as genetics, brain biology and chemistry, and your environment may play a role.  Who is at risk for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)? Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) usually begins when you are a teen or young adult. Boys often develop OCD at a younger age than girls.   Risk factors for OCD include: Family history. People with a first-degree relative (such as a parent, sibling, or child) who has OCD are at higher risk. This is especially true if the relative developed OCD as a child or teen. Brain structure and functioning. Imaging studies have shown that people with OCD have differences in certain parts of the brain. Researchers need to do more studies to understand the connection between the brain differences and OCD. Childhood trauma, such as child abuse. Some studies have found a link between trauma in childhood and OCD. More research is needed to understand this relationship better.   In some cases, children may develop OCD or OCD symptoms following a streptococcal infection. This is called Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal Infections (PANDAS).  What are the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)? People with OCD may have symptoms of obsessions, compulsions, or both: Obsessions are repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety. They may involve things such as    Fear of germs or contamination  Fear of losing or misplacing something  Worries about harm coming towards yourself or others  Unwanted forbidden thoughts involving sex or religion  Aggressive thoughts towards yourself or others  Needing things lined up exactly or arranged in a particular, precise way   Compulsions are behaviors that you feel like you need to do over and over to try to reduce your anxiety or stop the obsessive thoughts. Some common compulsions include    Excessive cleaning and/or handwashing  Repeatedly checking on things, such as whether the door is locked or the oven is off  Compulsive counting  Ordering and arranging things in a particular, precise way     Some people with OCD also have Tourette syndrome or another tic disorder. Tics are sudden twitches, movements, or sounds that people do over and over. People who have tics cannot stop their body from doing these things.  How is obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) diagnosed? The first step is to talk with your health care provider about your symptoms. It's important to check whether a physical problem is causing your symptoms. So your provider will do a physical exam and will ask you about your medical history. If  your symptoms do not seem to be caused by a physical problem, your provider may do an OCD test or may refer you to a mental health specialist for further evaluation or treatment.  Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) can sometimes be hard to diagnose. Its symptoms are like those of other mental disorders, such as anxiety disorders. It is also possible to have both OCD and another mental disorder.   Not everyone who has obsessions or compulsions has OCD. Your symptoms would usually be considered OCD when you: Can't control your thoughts or behaviors, even when you know that they are excessive Spend at least 1 hour a day on these thoughts or behaviors Don't get pleasure when performing the behaviors. But doing them may briefly give you relief from the anxiety. Have significant problems in your daily life because of these thoughts or behaviors   What are the treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)? The main treatments for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are cognitive behavioral therapy, medicines, or both: Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy. It teaches you different ways of thinking, behaving, and reacting to your obsessions and compulsions.       Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) s a specific type of CBT. ERP involves gradually exposing you to your fears or obsessions. You learn healthy ways to deal with the anxiety they cause.     Medicines for OCD include certain types of antidepressants. If those don't work for you, your provider may suggest taking some other type of psychiatric medicine.   If you have severe OCD that does not get better with these treatments, your provider may suggest a treatment called repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS). It is a brain stimulation procedure that uses magnetic waves. It can target specific brain areas associated with OCD.  NIH: National Institute of Mental Health",

    "summary": "Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act as we cope with life. It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, including as we age.  Many older adults are at risk for mental health problems. But this does not mean that mental health problems are a normal part of aging. Studies show that most older adults feel satisfied with their lives, even though they may have more illnesses or physical problems.  Sometimes, however, important life changes can make you feel uneasy, stressed, and sad. These changes could include the death of a loved one, retirement, or dealing with a serious illness. Many older adults will eventually adjust to the changes. But some people will have more trouble adjusting. This can put them at risk for mental disorders such as depression and anxiety.  It's important to recognize and treat mental disorders in older adults. These disorders don't just cause mental suffering. They can also make it harder for you to manage other health problems. This is especially true if those health problems are chronic.  Some of the warning signs of mental disorders in older adults include: Changes in mood or energy level A change in your eating or sleeping habits Withdrawing from the people and activities you enjoy Feeling unusually confused, forgetful, angry, upset, worried, or scared Feeling numb or like nothing matters Having unexplained aches and pains Feeling sadness or hopelessness Smoking, drinking, or using drugs more than usual Anger, irritability, or aggressiveness Having thoughts and memories that you can't get out of your head Hearing voices or believing things that are not true Thinking of harming yourself or others   If you think that you may have a mental health problem, get help. Talk therapy and/or medicines can treat mental disorders. If you don't know where to start, contact your primary care provider.",

    "disease": "Opioid Overdose",
    "summary": "What are opioids? Opioids, sometimes called narcotics, are a type of drug. They include strong prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid.   A health care provider may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some providers prescribe them for chronic pain.   Prescription opioids used for pain relief are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by your provider. However, people who take opioids are at risk for opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose. These risks increase when these medicines are misused. Misuse can include taking more than your prescribed dose or taking it more often, using it to get high, or taking someone else's opioids.  What is an opioid overdose? Opioids affect the part of the brain that regulates breathing. When people take high doses of opioids, it can lead to an overdose, with the slowing or stopping of breathing and sometimes death.  What causes an opioid overdose? An opioid overdose can happen for a variety of reasons, including if you: Take an opioid to get high. Take an extra dose of a prescription opioid or take it too often (either accidentally or on purpose). Mix an opioid with other medicines, illegal drugs, or alcohol. An overdose can be fatal when mixing an opioid and certain anxiety treatment medicines, such as Xanax or Valium. Take an opioid medicine that was prescribed for someone else. Children are especially at risk of an accidental overdose if they take medicine not intended for them.   There is also a risk of overdose if you are getting medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). MOUD is a treatment for OUD. Many of the medicines used for MOUD are also controlled substances that can be misused.   Who is at risk of an opioid overdose? Anyone who takes an opioid can be at risk of an overdose, but you are at higher risk if you: Take illegal opioids Take more opioid medicine than you are prescribed Combine opioids with other medicines and/or alcohol Have certain medical conditions, such as sleep apnea, or reduced kidney  or liver function Are over 65 years old   What are the signs of an opioid overdose? The signs of an opioid overdose include:  Very small pupils of the eyes Falling asleep or loss of consciousness Slow, shallow breathing Choking or gurgling sounds Vomiting Limp body Pale, blue, or cold skin Faint heartbeat Purple lips and fingernails   What should I do if I think that someone is having an opioid overdose? If you think someone is having an opioid overdose: Call 911 immediately. Give the person naloxone, if it is available. Naloxone is a safe medication that can quickly stop an opioid overdose. There are two forms. One is a nasal spray that you spray info the nose. The other type is injected into the muscle under the skin, or into the veins. Naloxone  works by blocking the effects of the opioids on the body. It's important to read the product instructions and check the expiration date before you give it to someone. Try to keep the person awake and breathing. Lay the person on their side to prevent choking. Stay with the person until emergency workers arrive.   Naloxone won't harm someone if they're overdosing on drugs other than opioids, so it's best to use it if you think someone is overdosing.  Can an opioid overdose be prevented? If you are taking opioid pain medicine, there are steps you can take to help prevent an opioid overdose:  Take your medicine exactly as prescribed by your provider. Do not take more medicine at once or take medicine more often than you are supposed to. Never mix the pain medicines with alcohol, sleeping pills, or illegal substances. Store your medicine safely where children or pets can't reach it. Consider using a medicine lockbox. Besides keeping children safe, it also prevents someone who lives with you or visits your house from stealing your medicines. Dispose of unused medicine promptly.   It is also important to teach your family and friends how to respond to an overdose. If you are at higher risk of an overdose, you will want get naloxone and carry it with you wherever you go. You can buy naloxone at a pharmacy.",

You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some health care providers prescribe them for chronic pain.   Prescription opioids used for pain relief are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by your provider. However, opioid use disorder (OUD) is still a possible risk.  What is opioid use disorder (OUD)? Opioid use disorder (OUD) means that you have a problematic pattern of using opioids. The pattern causes a lot of distress and impairment (meaning that it causes problems in and interferes with your daily life). Instead of OUD, sometimes people use the terms \"opioid dependence\" and \"opioid addiction.\" Dependence means feeling withdrawal symptoms when not taking the drug. Addiction is a chronic brain disease that causes a person to compulsively seek out drugs, even though they cause harm.    What are the treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD)? Treatments for OUD include: Medicines; this kind of treatment is known as medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) Counseling and behavioral therapies Residential and hospital-based treatment   Which medicines treat opioid opioid use disorder (OUD)? The medicines used in MOUD are methadone, buprenorphine, and naltrexone:  Methadone, buprenorphine, and lofexidine, which can decrease withdrawal symptoms and cravings. They work by acting on one or another of the targets in the brain that opioids act on. But these medicines are different because they do not make you feel high. Some people worry that if they take methadone or buprenorphine, it means that they are substituting one addiction for another. But it is not; these medicines are a treatment. They restore balance to the parts of the brain affected by addiction. This allows your brain to heal while you work toward recovery.  You may safely take these medicines for months, years, or even a lifetime. If you want to stop taking them, do not do it on your own. You should contact your provider first, and together you can work out a plan for stopping.  Naltrexone works differently than methadone and buprenorphine. It does not help you with withdrawal symptoms or cravings. Instead, it takes away the high that you would normally get when you take opioids. Because of this, you would take naltrexone to prevent a relapse, not to try to get off opioids. You have to be off opioids for at least 7-10 days before you can take naltrexone. Otherwise you could have bad withdrawal symptoms.  A combination drug that includes buprenorphine and naloxone. Naloxone is a drug to treat an opioid overdose. If you take it along with buprenorphine, you will be less likely to misuse the buprenorphine.   How does counseling help treat opioid use disorder (OUD)? Counseling for OUD can help you: Change your attitudes and behaviors related to drug use Build healthy life skills Stick with other forms of treatment, such as medicines   There are different types of counseling for OUD, including: Individual counseling, which may include setting goals, talking about setbacks, and celebrating progress. You may also talk about legal concerns and family problems. Counseling often includes specific behavioral therapies, such as     Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps you recognize and stop negative patterns of thinking and behavior. It teaches you coping skills, including how to manage stress and change the thoughts that cause you to want to misuse opioids.  Motivational enhancement therapy, which helps you build up motivation to stick with your treatment plan.  Contingency management, which focuses on giving you incentives for positive behaviors such as staying off the opioids.   Group counseling, which can help you feel that you are not alone with your issues. You get a chance to hear about the difficulties and successes of others who have the same challenges. This can help you learn new strategies for dealing with the situations you may come across. Family counseling, which includes partners or spouses and other family members who are close to you. It can help to repair and improve your family relationships.    Counselors can also refer you to other resources that you might need, such as: Peer support groups, including 12-step programs like Narcotics Anonymous Spiritual and faith-based groups HIV testing and hepatitis screening Case or care management Employment or educational supports Organizations that help you find housing or transportation   What are residential and hospital-based treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD)? Residential programs combine housing and treatment services. You are living with your peers, and you can support each other to stay in recovery. Inpatient hospital-based programs combine health care and OUD treatment services for people with medical problems. Hospitals may also offer intensive outpatient treatment. All these types of treatments are very structured, and usually include several different kinds of counseling and behavioral therapies. They usually also include MOUD.",

Misuse can include taking more than your prescribed dose or taking it more often, using it to get high, or taking someone else's opioids.  Opioid use disorder and overdoses are serious public health problems in the United States. As more people misuse opioids, more women are misusing opioids during pregnancy. This can lead to health risks for the mother and baby. The baby may be born with neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS).  NAS is a group of withdrawal symptoms that a baby has after being exposed to drugs during pregnancy.   Another problem with increased opioid misuse is that it can also lead to more heroin use. There are some people who switch from prescription opioids to heroin because heroin may be cheaper and easier to get.  How are opioid use disorder (OUD) and opioid overdose treated?  There are effective medicines to treat OUD. Using medicines to treat OUD is called medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). MOUD can help you stop using the drug, get through withdrawal, and cope with cravings. It is often combined with behavioral therapy and counseling.

It's the most common type of arthritis.  In a healthy joint, the ends of the bones are covered with a smooth, slippery tissue called cartilage. The cartilage pads the bones and helps them glide easily when you move the joint. With osteoarthritis, the cartilage breaks down and becomes rough. Sometimes, all the cartilage wears away and the bones rub together. Bumps of extra bone called bone spurs may grow in the joint area.  There is no cure for osteoarthritis. It usually gets worse slowly. But there's a lot you can do to manage the symptoms.  What are the symptoms of osteoarthritis? Osteoarthritis affects people in different ways, and not everyone has pain.

The disease can develop when your bone mineral density and bone mass decrease. It can also happen if the structure and strength of your bones change.  Osteoporosis is called a \"silent\" disease because it doesn't usually cause symptoms. You may not even know you have the disease until you break a bone. This could happen with any bone, but it's most common in the bones of your hip, vertebrae in the spine, and wrist.  What causes osteoporosis?  Your bones are made of living tissue. To keep them strong, your body breaks down old bone and replaces it with new bone. Osteoporosis develops when more bone is broken down than replaced. You lose bone mass and changes happen in the structure of your bone tissue. This can happen as you get older. Other risk factors can also lead to the development of osteoporosis or increase your chance of developing the disease.   Who is more likely to develop osteoporosis?

It can be permanent, when an organ must be removed.  It can be temporary, when the organ needs time to heal.  The organ could be the small intestine, colon, rectum, or bladder. With an ostomy, there must be a new way for wastes to leave the body.   There are many different types of ostomy. Some examples are: Ileostomy - the bottom of the small intestine (ileum) is attached to the stoma. This bypasses the colon, rectum and anus. Colostomy - the colon is attached to the stoma. This bypasses the rectum and the anus.  Urostomy - the tubes that carry urine to the bladder are attached to the stoma. This bypasses the bladder.

    "summary": "What is ovarian cancer?  Cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells in the body grow out of control and form a tumor. Ovarian cancer is a cancerous tumor that forms in the tissues of an ovary. The ovaries are a pair of female reproductive glands that make eggs and female hormones.  What are the types of ovarian cancer? There are a few different types of ovarian cancer. The most common type is epithelial cancer. It begins in the cells that cover the ovary.   There are also two related types of epithelial cancer that can spread to the ovaries:  Fallopian tube cancer forms in the tissue lining a fallopian tube. The fallopian tubes are a pair of long, slender tubes on each side of the uterus. The uterus is the female reproductive organ where a fetus grows during pregnancy. Primary peritoneal cancer forms in the tissue lining the peritoneum. Your peritoneum is a tissue lining that covers the organs in the abdomen (belly).    These two cancers are like ovarian cancer, and they have the same treatments. So some medical experts also consider those two types as ovarian cancer. Some other rarer types of ovarian cancer are malignant germ cell tumors and stromal tumors.  What causes ovarian cancer? Ovarian cancer happens when there are changes (mutations) in the genetic material  (DNA). Often, the exact cause of these genetic changes is unknown. Most ovarian cancers are caused by genetic changes that happen during your lifetime. But sometimes these genetic changes are inherited, meaning that you are born with them. Ovarian cancer that is caused by inherited genetic changes is called hereditary ovarian cancer. There are also certain genetic changes that can raise your risk of ovarian cancer, including changes called BRCA1 and BRCA2. These two changes also raise your risk of breast and other cancers. Besides genetics, your lifestyle and the environment can affect your risk of ovarian cancer.  Who is more likely to develop ovarian cancer? Certain people are more likely to develop ovarian cancer. They include those who:  Have a family history of ovarian cancer in a mother, aunt, grandmother, or sister Have inherited changes in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes Have certain other genetic conditions, such as Lynch syndrome Have endometriosis Took hormone replacement therapy Are overweight or have obesity Are tall Are older, especially those who have gone through menopause Have never been pregnant   What are the symptoms of ovarian cancer? Ovarian cancer may not cause early signs or symptoms. By the time you do have signs or symptoms, the cancer is often advanced.   The signs and symptoms may include:  Pain, swelling, or a feeling of pressure in the abdomen (belly) or pelvis Sudden or frequent urge to urinate (pee) Trouble eating or feeling full A lump in the pelvic area Gastrointestinal problems, such as gas, bloating, or constipation   How is ovarian cancer diagnosed? To find out if you have ovarian cancer, your health care provider:  Will ask about your medical history, including your symptoms Will ask about your family health history, including relatives who have had ovarian cancer Will do a physical exam, including a pelvic exam Will likely do imaging tests May do blood tests such as a CA-125 blood test    Often the only way to know for sure that you have ovarian cancer is by having a biopsy of the tissue. A biopsy is done during surgery to remove the tumor.  What are the treatments for ovarian cancer? Treatments for ovarian cancer may include:  Surgery to remove as much of the cancer as possible Chemotherapy Targeted therapy, which uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells with less harm to normal cells   Your provider may suggest that you have genetic testing to look for the gene changes that raise the risk for ovarian cancer. Knowing whether you have the gene change may help your provider decide on your treatment plan.  NIH: National Cancer Institute",

Most ovarian cysts are small and don't cause symptoms. Women may not find out that they have them until they have a pelvic exam. If there are symptoms, they may include: Pressure Bloating Swelling Pain in the lower abdomen, on the side where the cyst is   If your health care provider finds a cyst, you may be able to wait to see if it gets bigger. You may need surgery if you have pain, are past menopause, or if the cyst does not go away. If a cyst bursts or causes bleeding, you should get medical help right away. Birth control pills can help prevent new cysts.  Rarely, ovarian cysts can become cancerous. This risk increases as you get older.

    "summary": "What is oxygen? Oxygen is a gas that your body needs to work properly. Your cells need oxygen to make energy. Your lungs absorb oxygen from the air you breathe. The oxygen enters your blood from your lungs and travels to your organs and body tissues.  Certain medical conditions can cause your blood oxygen levels to be too low. Low blood oxygen may make you feel short of breath, tired, and confused. It can also damage your body. Oxygen therapy can help you get more oxygen.  What is oxygen therapy? Oxygen therapy is a treatment that provides you with extra oxygen to breathe in. It is also called supplemental oxygen. It is only available through a prescription from your health care provider. You may get it in the hospital, another medical setting, or at home. Some people only need it for a short period of time. Others will need long-term oxygen therapy. There are different types of devices that can give you oxygen. Some use tanks of liquid or gas oxygen. Others use an oxygen concentrator, which pulls oxygen out of the air. You will get the oxygen through a nose tube (cannula), a mask, or a tent. The extra oxygen is breathed in along with normal air. There are portable versions of the tanks and oxygen concentrators. They can make it easier for you to move around while using your therapy.  Who needs oxygen therapy? You may need oxygen therapy if you have a condition that causes low blood oxygen, such as: COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) Pneumonia COVID-19 A severe asthma attack Late-stage heart failure Cystic fibrosis Sleep apnea   What are the risks of using oxygen therapy? Oxygen therapy is generally safe, but it can cause side effects. They include a dry or bloody nose, tiredness, and morning headaches.\t Oxygen poses a fire risk, so you should never smoke or use flammable materials when using oxygen. If you use oxygen tanks, make sure your tank is secured and stays upright. If it falls and cracks or the top breaks off, the tank can fly like a missile.   What is hyperbaric oxygen therapy? Hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) is a different type of oxygen therapy. It involves breathing oxygen in a pressurized chamber or tube. That allows your lungs to gather up to three times more oxygen than you would get by breathing oxygen at normal air pressure. The extra oxygen moves through your blood and to your organs and body tissues.  HBOT is used to treat certain serious wounds, burns, injuries, and infections. It also treats air or gas embolisms (bubbles of air in your bloodstream), decompression sickness suffered by divers, and carbon monoxide poisoning. But some treatment centers claim that HBOT can treat almost anything, including Alzheimer's disease, autism, cancer, and Lyme disease. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not cleared or approved the use of HBOT for these conditions. There are risks to using HBOT, so always check with your provider before you try it.",

They are devices that are implanted in your chest or abdomen.  A pacemaker helps control abnormal heart rhythms. It uses electrical pulses to prompt the heart to beat at a normal rate. It can speed up a slow heart rhythm, control a fast heart rhythm, and coordinate the chambers of the heart.  An ICD monitors heart rhythms. If it senses dangerous rhythms, it delivers shocks. This treatment is called defibrillation. An ICD can help control life-threatening arrhythmias, especially those that can cause sudden cardiac arrest (SCA). Most new ICDs can act as both a pacemaker and a defibrillator. Many ICDs also record the heart's electrical patterns when there is an abnormal heartbeat.

    "summary": "What is Paget's disease of bone?  Paget's disease of bone is a chronic bone disorder. Normally, there is a process in which your bones break down and then regrow. In Paget's disease, this process is abnormal. There is excessive breakdown and regrowth of bone. Because the bones regrow too quickly, they are bigger and softer than normal. They may be misshapen and easily fractured (broken). Paget's usually affects just one or a few bones.  What causes Paget's disease of bone? Researchers do not know for sure what causes Paget's disease. Environmental factors may play a role. In some cases, the disease runs in families, and several genes have been linked to the disease.   Who is at risk for Paget's disease of bone? The disease is more common in older people and those of northern European heritage. If you have a close relative who has Paget's, you are much more likely to have it.   What are the symptoms of Paget's disease of bone? Many people do not know that they have Paget's, because it often has no symptoms. When there are symptoms, they are similar to those of arthritis and other disorders. The symptoms include: Pain, which may be due to the disease or to arthritis, which can be a complication of Paget's Headaches and hearing loss, which can happen when Paget's disease affects the skull Pressure on the nerves, which can happen when Paget's disease affects the skull or spine Increased head size, bowing of a limb, or curvature of the spine. This can happen in advanced cases. Hip pain, if Paget's disease affects the pelvis or thighbone Damage to the cartilage of your joints, which may lead to arthritis  Usually, Paget's disease gets worse slowly over time. It does not spread to normal bones.  What other problems can Paget's disease of bone cause? Paget's disease can lead to other complications, such as: Arthritis, because the misshapen bones can cause increased pressure and more wear and tear on the joints Heart failure. In severe Paget's disease, the heart has to work harder to pump blood to affected bones. Heart failure is more likely if you also have hardening of the arteries. Kidney stones, which can happen when the excessive breakdown of the bone leads to extra calcium in the body Nervous system problems, since the bones can cause pressure on the brain, spinal cord, or nerves. There may also be reduced blood flow to the brain and spinal cord. Osteosarcoma, cancer of the bone Loose teeth, if Paget's disease affects the facial bones Vision loss, if Paget's disease in the skull affects the nerves. This is rare.   How is Paget's disease of bone diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A physical exam An x-ray of the affected bones. Paget's disease is almost always diagnosed using x-rays. An alkaline phosphatase blood test A bone scan   Sometimes the disease is found by accident when one of these tests is done for another reason.  What are the treatments for Paget's disease of bone? To avoid complications, it is important to find and treat Paget's disease early. The treatments include: Medicines. There are several different medicines to treat Paget's disease. The most common type is bisphosphonates. They help reduce bone pain and stop or slow down the progress of the disease. Surgery is sometimes needed for certain complications of the disease. There are surgeries to \t \t\tAllow fractures (broken bones) to heal in a better position \t\tReplace joints such as the knee and hip when there is severe arthritis \t\tRealign a deformed bone to reduce the pain in weight-bearing joints, especially the knees \t\tReduce pressure on a nerve, if enlargement of the skull or spine injuries effects the nervous system \t   Diet and exercise do not treat Paget's, but they can help to keep your skeleton healthy. If you do not have kidney stones, you should make sure to get enough calcium and vitamin D through your diet and supplements. Besides keeping your skeleton healthy, exercise can prevent weight gain and maintain the mobility of your joints. Talk with your health care provider before you start a new exercise program.

    "disease": "Pain",
    "summary": "What is pain? Pain is a signal in your nervous system that something may be wrong. It is an unpleasant feeling, such as a prick, tingle, sting, burn, or ache. Each person feels pain differently, even if the reason for the pain is the same.  Pain may be sharp or dull. It may be mild or severe. Pain may come and go, or it may be constant. You may feel pain in one area of your body, such as your back, abdomen, chest, or pelvis, or you may feel it all over.  Pain can help alert you that there is a problem. If you never felt pain, you might seriously hurt yourself without knowing it, or you might not realize you have a medical problem that needs treatment. Finding out what's causing your pain will help your health care provider determine the best way to manage or treat it.   What are the types of pain? Patterns and types of pain are named based on how long and how often you have pain. These include:  Acute pain usually happens suddenly because of a disease, injury, or inflammation (irritation, redness, and/or swelling). This type of pain is often sharp and acts as a warning that something is wrong. It usually goes away when the cause is treated or healed, though sometimes it can turn into chronic pain. Some examples of causes of acute pain include broken bones or dental issues. Chronic pain lasts for longer than three months or the time in which you should have healed.  It can affect all aspects of daily life, including your mood and relationships. Some conditions that might cause chronic pain include arthritis or back problems. Episodic pain can happen from time to time and may occur with long-term medical conditions. Some conditions that might cause episodic pain include sickle cell disease or chronic migraines.   Pain may also be categorized by what is likely to be the cause of the pain. Pain may be described as nociceptive (caused by tissue damage or inflammation), neuropathic (caused by nerve damage), or nociplastic (caused by changes in how your nervous system processes pain).      What causes pain? Understanding what causes pain and why people feel it differently may be difficult. Often, it's easier to find the cause of acute pain due to an injury than the cause of chronic pain, or you may have an ongoing cause of pain, such as cancer.  In some cases, there is no clear cause. Environmental factors and psychological factors such as stress and beliefs about pain may affect the way you feel pain and respond to treatment.   How is pain diagnosed? You are the only one who knows how your pain feels. Your provider can best measure your pain by how you report it. They may ask you:  Where is the pain in your body? How long have you had the pain? How does the pain feel, such as stinging, burning, or sharp? How often do you have pain? When do you feel pain, such as in the morning, evening, or all the time? What relieves the pain? How does pain affect your daily life? Is the pain mild, moderate, or severe? To rate the pain on a scale.   If the cause of your pain is unknown, your provider may also do a physical exam and order blood tests or other medical tests to help find the cause.   What are the treatments for pain? Pain is not always curable, but there are many ways to manage and treat it. Treatment depends on the cause and type of pain. Treatments may include medicines, such as pain relievers. There are also non-drug treatments, such as acupuncture, physical therapy, and sometimes surgery.  Depending on the cause of your pain and your symptoms, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes. These may include suggestions for:  Eating a healthy diet Adding exercise Losing weight Managing stress Improving mental health   NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",

There are many different pain medicines, and each with advantages and risks. Some types of pain respond better to certain medicines than others. Each person may also have a slightly different response to a pain reliever.   What are the types of over-the-counter pain relievers? Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines are good for many types of pain. Two types of OTC pain medicines are usually recommended for mild to moderate pain.  Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is used in many OTC and prescription medicines. It's often considered safer than other pain relievers. Unfortunately, it's common for people to take too much  accidentally. Be careful not to take too much each day or use more than one medicine with acetaminophen. Check with your health care provider before taking medicines containing acetaminophen for more than ten days or five days for your child.  Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) include aspirin, naproxen (Aleve), and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). These pain relievers are often most effective if you have pain and inflammation (swelling), such as for arthritis or menstrual cramps. If you take more than the recommended amount, NSAIDs may cause nausea, stomach pain, or ulcers.   What are prescription pain relievers? If OTC pain relievers don't relieve your pain, your provider may prescribe something stronger. Many NSAIDs are also available at higher prescription doses.  The most powerful pain relievers are opioids, sometimes called narcotics. They include strong prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, or morphine. Opioids are sometimes used to treat moderate to severe pain. Your provider may give you a prescription to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery.  Opioids are very effective, but they can sometimes have serious side effects. There is also a risk of addiction. Because of the risks, you must use them only under your provider's supervision.   What are some non-drug treatments for pain? Pain relievers are just one part of a pain treatment plan. Environmental factors, stress, and beliefs about pain may affect the way you feel about pain and respond to treatment.   There are many things you can do to help ease pain. Treatment depends on the cause and type of pain. It's important to check with your provider before trying any of them.

    "disease": "Pancreatitis",
    "summary": "The pancreas is a large gland behind the stomach and close to the first part of the small intestine. It secretes digestive juices into the small intestine through a tube called the pancreatic duct. The pancreas also releases the hormones insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream.  Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas. It happens when digestive enzymes start digesting the pancreas itself. Pancreatitis can be acute or chronic. Either form is serious and can lead to complications.  Acute pancreatitis occurs suddenly and usually goes away in a few days with treatment. It is often caused by gallstones.  Common symptoms are severe pain in the upper abdomen, nausea, and vomiting.   Treatment is usually a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and medicines to relieve pain.  Chronic pancreatitis does not heal or improve. It gets worse over time and leads to permanent damage. The most common cause is heavy alcohol use. Other causes include cystic fibrosis and other inherited disorders, high levels of calcium or fats in the blood, some medicines, and autoimmune conditions. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and oily stools. Treatment may also be a few days in the hospital for intravenous (IV) fluids, medicines to relieve pain, and nutritional support. After that, you may need to start taking enzymes and eat a special diet.  It is also important to not smoke or drink alcohol.  NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

    "summary": "What is panic disorder?  Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder.  It causes repeated panic attacks, which are sudden periods of intense fear, discomfort, or a sense of losing control. These attacks happen even though there is no real danger. They often cause physical symptoms. For example, you may have a rapid or pounding heartbeat and feel like you are having a heart attack.  If you have panic attacks, it doesn't mean you will develop a panic disorder. Many people only have one or two panic attacks in their lifetime and get better without treatment.   But some of the people who have panic attacks do develop panic disorder. They have repeated panic attacks. The attacks can happen as often as several times a day or as rarely as a few times a year. People with panic disorder often worry about having another attack. It may cause them to avoid places and situations where they had panic attacks in the past.   Panic disorder is not life-threatening, but it can be upsetting and affect your quality of life. And if it is not treated, it can sometimes lead to other health conditions, including depression and substance use disorders.  What causes panic disorder? The cause of panic disorder is unknown. Researchers think that certain factors may play a role:   Genetics - panic disorder sometimes runs in families. But no one knows for sure why some family members have it while others don't. Brain biology and chemistry. Your environment. Major stress.   Who is more likely to develop panic disorder?  Panic disorder is more common in women than men. It often starts in the late teens or early adulthood. Sometimes it starts when a person is under a lot of stress. People who have had trauma, especially in childhood, are more likely to develop panic disorder.  What are the symptoms of panic disorder? People with panic disorder may have:   Sudden and repeated panic attacks of overwhelming anxiety and fear A feeling of being out of control or a fear of death during a panic attack An intense worry about another panic attack A fear or avoidance of places and situations where they had panic attacks in the past Physical symptoms during a panic attack, such as: \t \t\tPounding or racing heart \t\tSweating or chills \t\tTrembling or shaking \t\tTrouble breathing \t\tThe feeling that they are choking \t\tWeakness or dizziness \t\tChest pain \t\tStomach pain or nausea \t    Panic attacks can happen anytime, without warning. They can last anywhere from a few minutes to over an hour.  How is panic disorder diagnosed? To find out if you have panic disorder, your health care provider:  Will ask about your medical history and symptoms May check if an unrelated physical problem is causing your symptoms, for example with: \t \t\tA physical exam \t\tBlood tests to check for thyroid problems and other possible conditions \t\tHeart health tests \t  May do a panic disorder test  May refer you to a mental health provider for the panic disorder test or other types of psychological evaluations    What are the treatments for panic disorder? Treatment for panic disorder usually includes one or more of the following:  Talk therapy, also called psychotherapy or counseling, which can help you understand your feelings. \t \t\tIt may include cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of talk therapy that helps you change your negative thoughts and how you react to things that cause you to feel anxiety. \t  Medicines, including: \t \t\tAntidepressants, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  \t\tAnti-anxiety medicines  \t    Your provider may also suggest that you follow a healthy lifestyle, which may help with panic disorder. It may include:  Avoiding alcohol Reducing caffeine Eating regular meals  Getting enough sleep  Getting regular exercise   Joining a support group may also be helpful.

In many cases, a benign tumor on a parathyroid gland makes it overactive. Or, the extra hormones can come from enlarged parathyroid glands. Very rarely, the cause is cancer.  If you do not have enough PTH, you have hypoparathyroidism. Your blood will have too little calcium and too much phosphorous.

PID causes scarring in these organs. This can lead to infertility, ectopic pregnancy, pelvic pain, abscesses (a collection of pus), and other serious problems. PID is the most common preventable cause of infertility in the United States.   What causes pelvic inflammatory disease? Many types of bacteria can cause PID, but it's often caused by sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Gonorrhea and chlamydia are the most common causes of PID.   You are at greater risk for PID if you:  Are sexually active and younger than age 25. Have more than one sex partner. Douche. Douching can push bacteria into your reproductive organs. It may also hide the signs of PID. Have an STI and do not get treated. Have had PID or an STI before.   It's not as common, but sometimes using an intrauterine device (IUD) for birth control can increase your risk for PID. However, your risk is usually only during the first three weeks after the IUD is placed inside your uterus.  What are the symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease? If you have PID, you may have mild or no symptoms. If you do have symptoms, the most common symptom is pain in the lower abdomen (belly). Other symptoms can include:  Fever Foul-smelling vaginal discharge Bleeding between periods  Pain or bleeding during sex Painful urination (peeing)   See your health care provider if you have any symptoms of PID or if you think you or your partner were exposed to an STI. Early treatment is important. Waiting too long for treatment increases the risk of infertility.  How is pelvic inflammatory disease diagnosed? There is no one test for PID. To check for PID, your provider may:   Ask about your medical and sexual history  Review your symptoms Do a pelvic exam Order blood, urine, and imaging tests    What is the treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease? Antibiotics are used to treat PID.  You must take all the medicine, even if your symptoms go away to make sure the infection is cured. You will likely need to follow up with your provider to make sure the treatment is working.   Tell your recent sex partner(s) so they can get tested and treated. Don't have sex until you finish treatment, otherwise you can reinfect each other.  If you're pregnant, have an abscess, or your symptoms don't go away, you may need to have surgery or be hospitalized for treatment.  Treatment cannot fix any permanent damage already done to your internal organs.   If you don't get treated, complications can occur, such as:  Scar tissue may develop in your fallopian tubes.  Infertility.  An abscess may develop in your reproductive organs. If untreated, this could become a life-threatening infection.   Long-term pelvic or abdominal (belly) pain.    Can pelvic inflammatory disease be prevented? The best way to protect yourself against STIs is not to have sex.   If you do decide to have sex, a few ways you can lower your risk include to:   Practice safe sex by using a condom every time you have sex, limit your number of sex partners, and ask your partners about their sexual history.   Get tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea every year and ask your partner to get tested.  Don't douche since this can upset the balance of bacteria in your vagina.",

    "summary": "What are painful periods?  Menstruation, or period, is normal vaginal bleeding that happens as part of a woman's monthly cycle. Many women have painful periods, also called dysmenorrhea. The pain is most often menstrual cramps, which are a throbbing, cramping pain in your lower abdomen. You may also have other symptoms, such as lower back pain, nausea, diarrhea, and headaches. Period pain is not the same as premenstrual syndrome (PMS). PMS causes many different symptoms, including weight gain, bloating, irritability, and fatigue. PMS often starts one to two weeks before your period starts.  What causes painful periods?  There are two types of dysmenorrhea: primary and secondary. Each type has different causes.  Primary dysmenorrhea is the most common kind of period pain. It is period pain that is not caused by another condition. The cause is usually having too many prostaglandins, which are chemicals that your uterus makes. These chemicals make the muscles of your uterus tighten and relax, and this causes the cramps.  The pain can start a day or two before your period. It normally lasts for a few days, though in some women it can last longer.  You usually first start having period pain when you are younger, just after you begin getting periods. Often, as you get older, you have less pain. The pain may also get better after you have given birth.  Secondary dysmenorrhea often starts later in life. It is caused by conditions that affect your uterus or other reproductive organs, such as endometriosis and uterine fibroids. This kind of pain often gets worse over time. It may begin before your period starts and continue after your period ends.  What can I do about period pain?  To help ease your period pain, you can try: Using a heating pad or hot water bottle on your lower abdomen Getting some exercise Taking a hot bath Doing relaxation techniques, including yoga and meditation   You might also try taking over-the-counter pain relievers such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). NSAIDs include ibuprofen and naproxen. Besides relieving pain, NSAIDs reduce the amount of prostaglandins that your uterus makes and lessen their effects.  This helps to lessen the cramps. You can take NSAIDs when you first have symptoms, or when your period starts. You can keep taking them for a few days. You should not take NSAIDS if you have ulcers or other stomach problems, bleeding problems, or liver disease. You should also not take them if you are allergic to aspirin. Always check with your health care provider if you are not sure whether or not you should take NSAIDs.  It may also help to get enough rest and avoid using alcohol and tobacco.  When should I get medical help for my period pain?  For many women, some pain during your period is normal. However, you should contact your health care provider if: NSAIDs and self-care measures don't help, and the pain interferes with your life Your cramps suddenly get worse You are over 25 and you get severe cramps for the first time You have a fever with your period pain You have the pain even when you are not getting your period   How is the cause of severe period pain diagnosed?  To diagnose severe period pain, your health care provider will ask you about your medical history and do a pelvic exam. You may also have an ultrasound or other imaging test. If your health care provider thinks you have secondary dysmenorrhea, you might have laparoscopy. It is a surgery that that lets your health care provider look inside your body.  What are treatments for severe period pain?  If your period pain is primary dysmenorrhea and you need medical treatment, your health care provider might suggest using hormonal birth control, such as the pill, patch, ring, or IUD. Another treatment option might be prescription pain relievers.  If you have secondary dysmenorrhea, your treatment depends upon the condition that is causing the problem. In some cases, you may need surgery.",

They also carry messages from your body to your brain, so you can feel things, such as pain, heat, and cold.  What are peripheral nerve disorders? Peripheral nerve disorders happen when one or more peripheral nerves are damaged. Damaged nerves may not carry messages correctly, or they may not work at all. As a result, you may have pain, trouble walking, or a variety of other problems, depending on which nerves are involved.   Peripheral nerve disorders are very common. There are more than 100 different types.   What causes peripheral nerve disorders? Many things can damage nerves and lead to peripheral nerve disorders:  Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral nerve disorders. Most people with diabetes will develop diabetic nerve problems.  Physical injury (trauma) that stretches, crushes, squeezes, cuts, or puts pressure on one or more nerves. Some examples of peripheral nerve disorders from physical injury include  complex regional pain syndrome and brachial plexus injuries.  Health conditions, including: \t \t\tCertain cancers and their treatment (chemotherapy and radiation therapy). \t\tInfections, such as HIV and Lyme disease. \t\tProblems with blood or blood vessels. \t\tAutoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. \t\tKidney or liver disease.  \t  Certain medicines. Contact with certain toxic substances, such as lead or mercury. Alcohol use disorder (AUD) and smoking. Vitamin imbalances, especially a lack of vitamin B12. Your genes, including changes in your genes or conditions that you inherit from your parents, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.  In certain cases, the cause of peripheral nerve disorder is not known.   What are the symptoms of peripheral nerve disorders? The symptoms of peripheral nerve disorders depend on which nerves are affected, what is causing the damage, and how serious it is:        \t \t\t \t\t\tTypes of nerves \t\t\tPossible symptoms of nerve damage \t\t \t \t \t\t \t\t\tMotor nerves control your muscles and all your movement, such as walking, talking, and using your hands. \t\t\t  Weak or aching muscles Problems with balance, walking, or using your arms and hands Cramps or twitching muscles Muscle shrinking\t  \t\t \t\t \t\t\tSensory nerves carry messages to your brain from your senses, including touch, hot and cold, and pain. \t\t\t  Tingling, numbness, or pain often in the hands and feet Not being able to feel heat, cold, or pain, such as a cut on your foot Pain from even light touch\t  \t\t \t\t \t\t\tAutonomic nerves send messages to your organs to control breathing, digestion, and other body functions that happen without thinking about them. \t\t\t  A heartbeat that's too fast or too slow Trouble swallowing Sweating too much or too little Vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation Problems with urination or sexual function\t  \t\t \t         Symptoms may range from mild to very strong. They may develop quickly over days or slowly over months and years. But they are rarely life-threatening.   How are peripheral nerve disorders diagnosed? To find out if you have a peripheral nerve disorder, your provider will:  Ask about your medical history Ask about your family health history Do a physical exam Order tests, which may include: \t \t\tBlood tests \t\tGenetic tests \t\tNerve tests that measure: \t\t\t \t\t\t\tElectrical activity in your nerves and muscles \t\t\t\tHow well your autonomic nerves are working \t\t\t \t\t \t\tA biopsy of nerve or skin tissue \t\tCT or MRI scan to see what may be pressing on your nerves \t    What are the treatments for peripheral nerve disorders? It's important to treat any conditions that are causing nerve damage. In certain cases, that will allow your nerves to heal over time.   Treatment for symptoms depends on the type of peripheral nerve disorder you have, where it is, and how severe. Treatment options include:   Braces or splints Over-the-counter patches and skin creams Prescription medicines Non-drug pain management, such as electrical stimulation or relaxation therapy Surgery to relieve pressure on a nerve   Can peripheral nerve disorders be prevented? You can help prevent peripheral nerve disorders by:  Managing health conditions that may cause nerve damage, especially diabetes Preventing falls and accidents Avoiding toxic substances Being careful to avoid repeated motions and body positions that press on your nerves Eating a balanced diet, exercising, limiting alcohol, and not smoking   NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",

    "summary": "What is personality? Your personality is your own way of thinking, feeling, behaving, and relating to others. Once you become an adult, your personality usually doesn't change much.  What are personality disorders? Personality disorders are a group of mental disorders. They involve long-term patterns of thoughts and behaviors that are different from what is considered normal in your culture. The thoughts and behaviors are unhealthy and inflexible. They cause serious problems with relationships, work, and social activities. They can make it hard to deal with everyday stresses and problems.  What are the types of personality disorders? There are 10 types of personality disorders. They are grouped into three different categories called clusters. The types in each cluster have some similar symptoms and characteristics. The clusters and types are:  Cluster A personality disorders involve unusual and odd thoughts and behaviors. It includes:  Paranoid personality disorder, in which a person has paranoia (an extreme fear and distrust of others). They may think that someone is trying to harm them. Schizoid personality disorder, in which a person prefers to be alone and is not interested in having relationships with others. Schizotypal personality disorder, in which a person has unusual thoughts and ways of behaving and speaking. They are uncomfortable having close relationships with others.   Cluster B personality disorders involve dramatic and emotional thoughts and behaviors that can keep changing. It includes:  Antisocial personality disorder, in which a person has a long-term pattern of manipulating, exploiting, or violating the rights of others.  Borderline personality disorder, in which a person has lots of trouble managing their emotions. This makes them impulsive and uncertain about how they see themselves. It can cause a lot of trouble in their relationships. Histrionic personality disorder, in which a person is dramatic, has strong emotions, and always wants attention from others. Narcissistic personality disorder, in which a person lacks empathy and wants to be admired by others. They think that they are better than others and that they deserve special treatment.   Cluster C personality disorders involve anxious and fearful thoughts and behaviors. It includes:  Avoidant personality disorder, in which a person is very shy and feels that they are not as good as others. They often avoid people because they fear rejection. Dependent personality disorder, in which a person depends too much on others and feels that they need to be taken care of. They may let others treat them badly because they are afraid of losing the relationship. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder, in which a person needs control and order. They are perfectionists and can be inflexible. Although some of the symptoms are similar, this is not the same thing as obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).   What causes personality disorders? Personality disorders usually begin when someone is in their teens or early adult years. The cause is unknown. However, genes and childhood experiences such as abuse and trauma likely play a role.  What are the symptoms of personality disorders? The symptoms of each personality disorder are different. But each disorder involves problems and uncertainty with how people see themselves. The disorders also cause problems in relationships with other people.  People with personality disorders may have trouble realizing that they have a problem. To them, their thoughts are normal. They may see others as the problem. So they may not seek help when they need it. Or, if they seek help, it may be because of another reason. They may be looking for help because of other mental health symptoms or problems with relationships and work. Sometimes someone else, such as a family member or social agency, may ask them to get help.  How are personality disorders diagnosed? A mental health care provider can diagnose personality disorders. A mental health provider is a health care professional who specializes in diagnosing and treating mental health problems. To make a diagnosis, the provider will consider the person's symptoms, experiences, and family medical history. A thorough medical exam may also be done to help rule out other possible causes of the symptoms.   How are personality disorders treated? Talk therapy, also known as psychotherapy, is the main treatment for personality disorders. Medicines may help relieve certain symptoms, such as anxiety or mood swings.",

The bleeding could be external or internal. There can be various causes. If the problem is mild, you may not need treatment. For more serious cases, you may need medicines or blood or platelet transfusions. If your blood has too many platelets, you may have a higher risk of blood clots.    When the cause is unknown, this is called thrombocythemia. It is rare. You may not need treatment if there are no signs or symptoms. In other cases, people who have it may need treatment with medicines or procedures.  If another disease or condition is causing the high platelet count, it is thrombocytosis.

It can range from mild to severe, depending on the type of germ causing the infection, your age, and your overall health.  What causes pneumonia? Bacterial, viral, and fungal infections can cause pneumonia.  Bacteria are the most common cause. Bacterial pneumonia can occur on its own. It can also develop after you've had certain viral infections such as a cold or the flu. Several different types of bacteria can cause pneumonia, including: Streptococcus pneumoniae Legionella pneumophila; this pneumonia is often called Legionnaires' disease Mycoplasma pneumoniae Chlamydia pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae  Viruses that infect the respiratory tract may cause pneumonia. Viral pneumonia is often mild and goes away on its own within a few weeks. But sometimes it is serious enough that you need to get treatment in a hospital. If you have viral pneumonia, you are at risk of also getting bacterial pneumonia. The different viruses that can cause pneumonia include: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) Some common cold and flu viruses SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19  Fungal pneumonia is more common in people who have chronic health problems or weakened immune systems. Some of the types include: Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP)  Coccidioidomycosis, which causes valley fever Histoplasmosis Cryptococcus   Who is at risk for pneumonia? Anyone can get pneumonia, but certain factors can increase your risk: Age; the risk is higher for children who are age 2 and under and adults age 65 and older Exposure to certain chemicals, pollutants, or toxic fumes Lifestyle habits, such as smoking, heavy alcohol use, and malnourishment Being in a hospital, especially if you are in the ICU. Being sedated and/or on a ventilator raises the risk even more. Having a lung disease Having a weakened immune system Have trouble coughing or swallowing, from a stroke or other condition Recently being sick with a cold or the flu   What are the symptoms of pneumonia? The symptoms of pneumonia can range from mild to severe and include: Fever Chills Cough, usually with phlegm (a slimy substance from deep in your lungs) Shortness of breath Chest pain when you breathe or cough Nausea and/or vomiting Diarrhea  The symptoms can vary for different groups. Newborns and infants may not show any signs of the infection. Others may vomit and have a fever and cough. They might seem sick, with no energy, or be restless. Older adults and people who have serious illnesses or weak immune systems may have fewer and milder symptoms. They may even have a lower than normal temperature. Older adults who have pneumonia sometimes have sudden changes in mental awareness.  What other problems can pneumonia cause? Sometimes pneumonia can cause serious complications such as: Bacteremia, which happens when the bacteria move into the bloodstream. It is serious and can lead to septic shock. Lung abscesses, which are collections of pus in cavities of the lungs Pleural disorders, which are conditions that affect the pleura. The pleura is the tissue that covers the outside of the lungs and lines the inside of your chest cavity. Kidney failure Respiratory failure   How is pneumonia diagnosed? Sometimes pneumonia can be hard to diagnose. This is because it can cause some of the same symptoms as a cold or the flu. It may take time for you to realize that you have a more serious condition. Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A physical exam, including listening to your lungs with a stethoscope Various tests, such as \t\t \t\t\tA chest x-ray \t\t\tBlood tests such as a complete blood count (CBC) to see if your immune system is actively fighting an infection \t\t\tA Blood culture to find out whether you have a bacterial infection that has spread to your bloodstream \t\t   If you are in the hospital, have serious symptoms, are older, or have other health problems, you may also have more tests, such as: Sputum test, which checks for bacteria in a sample of your sputum (spit) or phlegm (slimy substance from deep in your lungs). Chest CT scan to see how much of your lungs is affected. It may also show if you have complications such as lung abscesses or pleural effusions.  Pleural fluid culture, which checks for bacteria in a fluid sample that was taken from the pleural space Pulse oximetry or blood oxygen level test, to check how much oxygen is in your blood Bronchoscopy, a procedure used to look inside your lungs' airways   What are the treatments for pneumonia? Treatment for pneumonia depends on the type of pneumonia, which germ is causing it, and how severe it is: Antibiotics treat bacterial pneumonia and some types of fungal pneumonia. They do not work for viral pneumonia. In some cases, your provider may prescribe antiviral medicines for viral pneumonia Antifungal medicines treat other types of fungal pneumonia   You may need to be treated in a hospital if your symptoms are severe or if you are at risk for complications. While there, you may get additional treatments. For example, if your blood oxygen level is low, you may receive oxygen therapy. It may take time to recover from pneumonia. Some people feel better within a week. For other people, it can take a month or more.  Can pneumonia be prevented? Vaccines can help prevent pneumonia caused by pneumococcal bacteria or the flu virus. Having good hygiene, not smoking, and having a healthy lifestyle may also help prevent pneumonia.

The sap is in the root, stems, leaves and fruit of these plants. If it gets on your skin, it causes a blistering skin rash. The rash can range from mild to severe, depending on how much sap gets on your skin and how sensitive you are to it. Problems can also happen if the plants are burned. Airborne sap-coated soot can get into the eyes, nose, throat and respiratory system.   The best way to avoid the rash is to learn what the plants look like and stay away from them.

    "disease": "Polio and Post-Polio Syndrome",
    "summary": "What is polio?  Polio, or poliomyelitis, is a disease that spreads from person to person. It is caused by the poliovirus. The virus attacks the nervous system. In serious cases, it can cause paralysis (where you can't move parts of the body). The paralysis may be lifelong and can sometimes be life-threatening.  Because of vaccines, polio is rare in the United States. But polio does occur in some parts of the world, and travelers can spread the virus.  How does polio spread? The poliovirus is very contagious. It spreads through contact with:  The stool (poop) of person who has the infection Droplets from a sneeze or cough of someone who has the infection   This contact can happen if:  You get contaminated stool or droplets on your hands and then touch your mouth A child puts contaminated toys or other objects into their mouth You share food or utensils with someone who has the infection   People who have the infection can spread it to others just before and up to several weeks after the symptoms appear. People who don't have symptoms can still spread the virus to others and make them sick.  Who is more likely to develop polio? Polio mainly affects children under age 5. But people of any age (including adults) who are unvaccinated are at risk of developing polio. People who live in or travel to areas where there is polio are more likely to get polio.  What are the symptoms of polio? Most people who get infected with poliovirus do not have any symptoms. But one out of four people who get polio will have flu-like symptoms. These symptoms usually last 2 to 5 days, and they include:  Sore throat Fever Fatigue Nausea Headache Stomach pain   In rare cases, polio can be very serious. It can lead to:  Meningitis, an infection of the covering of your spinal cord and/or brain. Weakness or paralysis in your arms, legs, or both. This paralysis or weakness can last a lifetime. It is possible for the paralysis to become life-threatening if it affects the muscles that you use to breathe. Post-polio syndrome (PPS), which happens later in life.   What is post-polio syndrome (PPS)? Post-polio syndrome (PPS) is a condition that affects polio survivors many years after they recovered from polio. It usually happens 15-40 years later. It is not contagious.  People who get PPS start having new weakening in muscles that were previously affected by the polio infection.  Symptoms may range from mild to serious. The symptoms of PPS include:  Muscle weakness Muscle atrophy (wasting away of muscles) Loss of muscle function Mental and physical fatigue Joint pain Curving of the spine (scoliosis)   PPS is rarely life-threatening, but the symptoms can interfere with your daily life.  How is polio diagnosed? If you think you or someone in your family has symptoms of polio, call your healthcare provider right away or go to an emergency room.  To find out if you or your child has polio, the provider:  Will do a physical exam. Will take a detailed medical history, including your vaccination history and history of any recent travel. Will collect samples of body fluids, such as stool, saliva, blood, urine, and spinal fluid. Poliovirus is most likely to be detected in stool specimens. May do an MRI to look at pictures of the spinal cord.    What are the treatments for polio and post-polio syndrome (PPS)? There is no cure or specific treatment for polio. For a mild case, getting rest and drinking plenty of liquids may help with some of the symptoms.  If the polio is more serious, you or your child may need:  Physical or occupational therapy to help with arm or leg weakness. The earlier therapy is started, the better.   Pain relievers to help with pain and treat fever. If your child is sick, do not give them aspirin unless their provider tells you to. A ventilator to help with breathing if the breathing muscles are weak or paralyzed.   There is no cure for PPS. Treatments may help you manage your symptoms. They include:  Non-fatiguing exercises (exercises that do not cause pain or fatigue that lasts more than 10 minutes). These exercises may improve muscle strength and reduce tiredness. Your provider can help you figure out which exercises are best for you.  Mobility aids.  Ventilation equipment. Lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet, getting enough sleep, and not smoking.    Can polio be prevented? There are two types of vaccine that can prevent polio:  Inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) given as an injection in the leg or arm, depending on how old you are. Since 2000, this has been the only polio vaccine used in the United States. Oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is given as drops in the mouth. It is still used throughout much of the world.   Children in the United States get four doses of PV as part of their routine childhood immunizations. Most adults in the United States were vaccinated against polio as children.   There is a one-time IPV booster. It may be given to adults who have completed their polio vaccinations but are at higher risk of contact with poliovirus. You may be at higher risk if you are:  Traveling to a country where the risk of getting polio is greater Working in a laboratory or healthcare setting and handling samples that might contain polioviruses A healthcare worker who has contact with patients who could have polio   Another way to help prevent the spread of polio is to wash your hands often with soap and water. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers will not kill poliovirus.   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

    "disease": "Polycystic Ovary Syndrome",
    "summary": "What is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)?  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the name for set of symptoms that are related to an imbalance of hormones. PCOS affects the ovaries, as well as many other parts of the body.  People with PCOS usually have at least two of these problems:  Not ovulating. Normally, your ovaries make the egg that is released each month as part of a healthy menstrual cycle. This is called ovulation. But with PCOS, the egg may not develop as it should, or it may not be released during ovulation. Your periods may be irregular, or you may not have them at all. High levels of androgens. Androgens are hormones that are important for normal male sexual development. Women normally make smaller amounts of androgens. Having higher levels of androgens can cause you to have extra body or facial hair (called hirsutism). Cysts in one or both ovaries. Cysts are growths that are small, fluid-filled sacs.   What causes polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? The exact cause of PCOS in unknown. Research has shown that different factors may play a role, including:  Genetics. PCOS tends to run in families. Imbalances in androgen levels. Insulin resistance. This is a condition in which your body can't use insulin properly. Insulin is a hormone that helps move blood glucose (sugar) into your cells to give them energy. Insulin resistance can lead to high blood glucose levels.   What are the symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? PCOS often develops as young as age 11 or 12, around the time of your first period. But you can develop it later.  The symptoms can vary from person to person. Some people have few or even no symptoms. They may not realize they have PCOS until they have trouble getting pregnant. Other people may have more severe symptoms.  The symptoms of PCOS may include:  Irregular or missed menstrual periods. Too much hair on the face, chest, stomach, or thighs. Obesity, weight gain, or trouble losing weight. Severe acne which may be hard to treat. Oily skin. Patches of thickened dark skin (called acanthosis nigricans). Infertility. PCOS is one of the most common causes of infertility. But many women with PCOS can still get pregnant.   What other health problems are linked to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? PCOS is linked to many other health problems, including:  Insulin resistance, which can lead to prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Heart disease. Having PCOS increases your risk, and this risk goes up as you age. High blood pressure. High LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol and low HDL (\"good\") cholesterol. This increases your risk of heart disease. Sleep apnea, a disorder that causes you to repeatedly stop breathing during sleep. Depression and anxiety.   Although there are links between PCOS and these conditions, researchers do not know whether:  PCOS causes some of these problems Some of these problems cause PCOS, or  There are other conditions that cause both PCOS and these other health problems   Not everyone who has PCOS will have all these problems. However, you and your health care provider may want to monitor your health for signs of them, so they can be treated early.  How is polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) diagnosed? There is no specific test for PCOS. To find out if you have PCOS, your provider:   Will do a physical exam, which will include looking for the physical signs of PCOS. Will ask about your medical history and family health history. May do a pelvic exam to check for signs of extra male hormones and to see if your ovaries are enlarged or swollen. May order a pelvic ultrasound to look for cysts on your ovaries and check the thickness of your endometrium (the lining of your uterus, or womb). May order blood tests, including tests to check your hormone levels.   What are the treatments for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? There is no cure for PCOS, but treatments can help you manage your symptoms. The treatments may include:  Lifestyle changes, which can help reduce many symptoms. They can also lower your risk for or help manage related health problems. These changes include:      Maintaining a healthy weight   Getting regular physical activity   Eating healthy foods     Medicines:      Hormonal birth control, such as pills, shots, and IUDs, can make your period more regular. They may also help remove acne and extra facial and body hair. But you would only use them if you don't want to get pregnant.   Anti-androgen medicines, which block the effect of androgens. This can help reduce hair loss on your head, the growth of facial and body hair, and acne. Providers do use them to help with these symptoms, but anti-androgen medicines are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat PCOS. These medicines can cause problems during pregnancy. Your provider may have you take them with birth control (to prevent pregnancy).   Insulin-sensitizing medicines, which are medicines that are used to treat type 2 diabetes. They improve insulin resistance and keep your blood glucose levels steady. They may also lower your androgen levels. They are not approved by the FDA to treat PCOS. But they may help with your symptoms.    Medicines for acne. These medicines come in pills, creams, or gels.     Treatments for hair removal, such as facial hair removal creams, laser hair removal, and electrolysis. Fertility treatments if you are having trouble getting pregnant. They include medicines and procedures such as in vitro fertilization (IVF).",

    "summary": "What is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?  Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disorder that some people develop after they experience or see a traumatic event. The traumatic event may be life-threatening, such as combat, a natural disaster, a car accident, or sexual assault. But sometimes the event is not necessarily a dangerous one. For example, the sudden, unexpected death of a loved one can also cause PTSD. It's normal to feel afraid during and after a traumatic situation. The fear triggers a \"fight-or-flight\" response. This is your body's way of helping to protect itself from possible harm. It causes changes in your body such as the release of certain hormones and increases in alertness, blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing. In time, most people recover from this naturally. But people with PTSD don't feel better. They feel stressed and frightened long after the trauma is over. In some cases, the PTSD symptoms may start later on. They might also come and go over time.  What causes post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)? Researchers don't know why some people get PTSD and others don't. Genetics, neurobiology, risk factors, and personal factors may affect whether you get PTSD after a traumatic event.  Who is more likely to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)? You can develop PTSD at any age. Many risk factors play a part in whether you will develop PTSD. They include: Your sex; women are more likely to develop PTSD Having had trauma in childhood Feeling horror, helplessness, or extreme fear Going through a traumatic event that lasts a long time Having little or no social support after the event Dealing with extra stress after the event, such as loss of a loved one, pain and injury, or loss of a job or home Having a history of mental illness or substance use   What are the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)? There are four types of PTSD symptoms, but they may not be the same for everyone. Each person experiences symptoms in their own way. The types are: Re-experiencing symptoms, when something reminds you of the trauma and you feel that fear again. Examples include \t\t \t\t\tFlashbacks, which cause you to feel like you are going through the event again \t\t\tNightmares \t\t\tFrightening thoughts \t\t  Avoidance symptoms, when you try to avoid situations or people that trigger memories of the traumatic event. This may cause you to \t\t \t\t\tStay away from places, events, or objects that are reminders of the traumatic experience. For example, if you were in a car accident, you might stop driving. \t\t\tAvoiding thoughts or feelings related to the traumatic event. For example, you might try to stay very busy to try to avoid thinking about what happened. \t\t  Arousal and reactivity symptoms, which may cause you to be jittery or be on the lookout for danger. They include \t\t \t\t\tBeing easily startled \t\t\tFeeling tense or \"on edge\" \t\t\tHaving difficulty sleeping \t\t\tHaving angry outbursts \t\t  Cognition and mood symptoms, which are negative changes in beliefs and feelings. They include \t\t \t\t\tTrouble remembering important things about the traumatic event \t\t\tNegative thoughts about yourself or the world \t\t\tFeeling blame and guilt \t\t\tNo longer being interested in things you enjoyed \t\t\tTrouble concentrating \t\t   The symptoms usually start soon after the traumatic event. But sometimes they may not appear until months or years later. They also may come and go over many years.  If your symptoms last longer than four weeks, cause you great distress, or interfere with your work or home life, you might have PTSD.  How is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) diagnosed? A health care provider who has experience helping people with mental illnesses can diagnose PTSD. The provider will do a mental health screening and may also do a physical exam. To get a diagnosis of PTSD, you must have all of these symptoms for at least one month: At least one re-experiencing symptom At least one avoidance symptom At least two arousal and reactivity symptoms At least two cognition and mood symptoms   What are the treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)? The main treatments for PTSD are talk therapy, medicines, or both. PTSD affects people differently, so a treatment that works for one person may not work for another. If you have PTSD, you need to work with a mental health professional to find the best treatment for your symptoms.: Talk therapy, or psychotherapy, can teach you about your symptoms. You will learn how to identify what triggers them and how to manage them. There are different types of talk therapy for PTSD.  Medicines can help with the symptoms of PTSD. Antidepressants may help control symptoms such as sadness, worry, anger, and feeling numb inside. Other medicines can help with sleep problems and nightmares.   Can post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) be prevented? There are certain factors that can help reduce the risk of developing PTSD. These are known as resilience factors, and they include: Seeking out support from other people, such as friends, family, or a support group Learning to feel good about your actions in the face of danger Having a coping strategy or a way of getting through the bad event and learning from it Being able to act and respond effectively despite feeling fear   NIH: National Institute of Mental Health",

    "disease": "Prediabetes",
    "summary": "What is prediabetes?  Prediabetes means that your blood glucose, or blood sugar, levels are higher than normal but not high enough to be called diabetes. Glucose comes from the foods you eat. Too much glucose in your blood can damage your body over time.  If you have prediabetes, you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. But if you make some lifestyle changes now, you may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes.  What causes prediabetes? Prediabetes usually happens when your body has a problem with insulin. Insulin is a hormone that helps the glucose get into your cells to give them energy. A problem with insulin could be: Insulin resistance, a condition in which the body can't use its insulin properly. It makes it hard for your cells to get glucose from your blood. This can cause your blood sugar levels to rise. Your body can't make enough insulin to keep your blood sugar levels at a healthy level  Researchers think that being overweight and not getting regular physical activity are major factors in causing prediabetes.  Who is at risk for prediabetes? About 1 out of every 3 adults has prediabetes. It is more common in people who: Are overweight or have obesity Are age 45 or older Have a parent, brother, or sister with diabetes Are African American, Alaska Native, American Indian, Asian American, Hispanic/Latino, Native Hawaiian, or Pacific Islander American Are not physically active Have health conditions such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol Have had gestational diabetes (diabetes in pregnancy) Have a history of heart disease or stroke Have metabolic syndrome Have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)   What are the symptoms of prediabetes? Most people don't know they have prediabetes because usually there are no symptoms.  Some people with prediabetes may have darkened skin in the armpit or on the back and sides of the neck. They may also have many small skin growths in those same areas.  How is prediabetes diagnosed? There are a few different blood tests that can diagnose prediabetes. The most common ones are: Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test, which measures your blood sugar at a single point in time. You need to fast (not eat or drink) for at least 8 hours before the test. The results of the test are given in mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter): \t\t \t\t\tA normal level is 99 or below \t\t\tPrediabetes is 100 to 125 \t\t\tType 2 diabetes is 126 and above \t\t  A1C test, which measures your average blood sugar over the past 3 months. The results of an A1C test are given as a percentage. The higher the percentage, the higher your blood sugar levels have been.  \t\t \t\t\tA normal level is below 5.7% \t\t\tPrediabetes is between 5.7 to 6.4% \t\t\tType 2 diabetes is above 6.5% \t\t   If I have prediabetes, will I get diabetes?  If you have prediabetes, you may be able to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes through lifestyle changes: Losing weight, if you are overweight Getting regular physical activity Following a healthy, reduced-calorie eating plan  In some cases, your health care provider may also recommend taking diabetes medicines.  Can prediabetes be prevented? If you are at risk for prediabetes, those same lifestyle changes (losing weight, regular physical activity, and a healthy eating plan) may prevent you from getting it.

To do that, it's important to:  Have regular visits with your health care provider. During prenatal care visits your provider checks your health and carefully monitors your pregnancy until you deliver a healthy baby.

    "summary": "What is nutrition, and why is it important during pregnancy? Nutrition is about eating a healthy and balanced diet so your body gets the nutrients that it needs. Nutrients are substances in foods that our bodies need so they can function and grow. They include carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, minerals, and water.  When you're pregnant, nutrition is more important than ever. You need more of many important nutrients than you did before pregnancy. Making healthy food choices every day will help you give your baby what they need to develop. It will also help make sure that you and your baby gain a healthy amount of weight.  Do I have any special nutritional needs now that I am pregnant? You need more folic acid, iron, calcium, and vitamin D than you did before pregnancy: Folic acid is a B vitamin that may help prevent neural tube defects.       Before pregnancy, you need 400 mcg (micrograms) per day.    During pregnancy and when breastfeeding, you need 600 mcg per day from foods and/or vitamins. It is hard to get this amount from foods alone, so you will most likely need to take a supplement that contains folic acid.     Iron is important for your baby's growth and brain development. During pregnancy, the amount of blood in your body increases, so you need more iron for yourself and your growing baby. You should get 27 mg (milligrams) of iron a day. Calcium during pregnancy can reduce your risk of preeclampsia. It's a serious medical condition that causes a sudden increase in your blood pressure. Calcium also builds up your baby's bones and teeth.      Pregnant adults should get 1,000 mg (milligrams) of calcium a day   Pregnant teenagers (ages 14-18) need 1,300 mg of calcium a day    Vitamin D helps the calcium to build your baby's bones and teeth. All women, pregnant or not, should be getting 600 IU (international units) of vitamin D per day.   Keep in mind that taking too much of a supplement can be harmful. For example, very high levels of vitamin A can cause birth defects. Only take vitamins and mineral supplements that your health care provider recommends. You also need more protein when you are pregnant. Healthy sources of protein include beans, peas, eggs, lean meats, seafood, and unsalted nuts and seeds. Getting enough fluids is another special nutritional concern during pregnancy. When you are pregnant, your body needs even more water to stay hydrated and support the life inside you. So it's important to drink enough fluids every day.  How much weight should I gain during my pregnancy? How much weight you should gain depends on your health and how much you weighed before pregnancy: If you were at a normal weight before pregnancy, you should gain about 25 to 35 pounds If you were underweight before pregnancy, you should gain more If you were overweight or had obesity before you became pregnant, you should gain less    Check with your provider to find out how much weight gain during pregnancy is healthy for you. You should gain the weight gradually during your pregnancy, with most of the weight gained in the last trimester.  Do I need to eat more calories when I am pregnant? How many calories you need depends on your weight gain goals. Your provider can tell you what your goal should be, based on things like your weight before pregnancy, your age, and how fast you gain weight. The general recommendations are: In the first trimester of pregnancy, you probably do not need extra calories In the second trimester, you usually need about 340 extra calories  In the last trimester, you may need around 450 extra calories per day During the final weeks of pregnancy, you may not need extra calories   Keep in mind that not all calories are equal. You should eat healthy foods that are packed with nutrients - not \"empty calories\" such as those found in soft drinks, candies, and desserts.  What foods should I avoid during pregnancy? During pregnancy, you should avoid: Alcohol. There is no known amount of alcohol that is safe for a woman to drink during pregnancy. Fish that may have high levels of mercury. Limit white (albacore) tuna to 6 ounces per week. Do not eat tilefish, shark, swordfish, marlin, orange roughy, or king mackerel. Foods that are more likely to contain germs that could cause foodborne illness, including \t Refrigerated smoked seafood like whitefish, salmon, and mackerel Undercooked meat, poultry, eggs, and seafood Refrigerated meat spreads Store-made salads, such as chicken, egg, or tuna salad Unpasteurized or raw milk Unpasteurized juices or cider Unpasteurized soft cheeses, such as unpasteurized feta, Brie, queso blanco, queso fresco, and blue cheeses Raw sprouts of any kind (including alfalfa, clover, radish, and mung bean) Raw cookie dough Unwashed fruits and vegetables \t  Too much caffeine. Drinking high amounts of caffeine may be harmful for your baby. For most people, it's best to limit caffeine to less than 200 mg per day during pregnancy. But first check with your provider about whether you should have caffeine at all.",

    "summary": "You may need to take medicines while you are pregnant. But not all medicines are safe during pregnancy. Many medicines carry risks for you, your baby, or both. Opioids, especially when misused, can cause problems for you and your baby while you are pregnant.  What are opioids? Opioids, sometimes called narcotics, are a type of drug. They include strong prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid.  A health care provider may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some providers prescribe them for chronic pain.  Prescription opioids used for pain relief are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by your provider. However, people who take opioids are at risk for opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose. These risks increase when these medicines are misused.  Misuse can include taking your opioid medicines in greater amounts or more often than you are supposed to, using them to get high, or taking someone else's opioids.  What are the risks of taking opioids during pregnancy? Taking opioids during pregnancy can cause problems for you and your baby. The possible risks include: Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) - withdrawal symptoms such as irritability, seizures, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and poor feeding in newborns Neural tube defects - birth defects of the brain, spine, or spinal cord Congenital heart defects - problems with the structure of the baby's heart Gastroschisis - a birth defect of the baby's abdomen, where the intestines stick outside of the body through a hole beside the belly button Loss of the baby, either miscarriage (before 20 weeks of pregnancy) or stillbirth (after 20 or more weeks) Preterm delivery - a birth before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy Stunted growth, leading to low birthweight Problems with the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby)   If your provider suggests that you take opioids during pregnancy, you should first discuss the risks and benefits. Then if you both decide that you need to take the opioids, you should work together to try to minimize the risks. Some of the ways to do this include: Taking them for the shortest time possible Taking the lowest dose that will help you Carefully following your provider's instructions for taking the medicines Contacting your provider if you have side effects Going to all your follow-up appointments   If I am already taking opioids and I become pregnant, what should I do? If you have been taking opioids and you become pregnant, contact your provider. But don't stop taking the opioids on your own. If you suddenly stop taking opioids, it could cause severe health problems for you or your baby. In some cases, stopping suddenly during pregnancy may be more harmful than taking the medicines.  Can I breastfeed while taking opioids? If you regularly take opioid medicines, you may be able to breastfeed. It depends on which medicine you are taking. But you should not breastfeed if you have HIV or take illegal drugs. Check with your provider before breastfeeding.   What is the treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) in pregnancy? If you are pregnant and have an opioid use disorder, do not stop taking opioids suddenly. Instead, see your provider so you can get help. The treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD) is called medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD). For MOUD during pregnancy, providers prescribe either buprenorphine or methadone. These medicines can reduce your cravings and help prevent withdrawal.  Counseling, including behavioral therapies, can also help you to change your attitudes and behaviors related to drug use and build healthy life skills.",

But it's also very important to avoid substances that could be harmful to you and your baby, such as tobacco, alcohol, and drugs.  Tobacco Smoking during pregnancy passes nicotine, carbon monoxide, and many other harmful chemicals to your baby. Nicotine is not only a health danger for you, but it can also damage your developing baby's brain and lungs. Carbon monoxide can keep the developing baby from getting enough oxygen.  If you smoke while pregnant, it raises the risk of your baby being born too small, too early, or with birth defects. During the first year of life, there is a higher risk of your baby dying from sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). And later in life, your child may be more likely to have health problems, such as asthma and obesity.  Other tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, also contain nicotine and are not safe to use during pregnancy. And some of the flavorings used in e-cigarettes may be harmful to developing babies.  You will also want to try to avoid secondhand smoke, which has some of the same risks as smoking during pregnancy.  Alcohol There is no known amount of alcohol that is safe for you to drink during pregnancy and while trying to get pregnant. All types of alcohol are equally harmful, including all wines and beer. The risks from drinking during pregnancy include problems with the growth of the developing baby and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). FASD is a life-long condition that can cause a mix of physical, behavioral, and learning problems.  Illegal drugs Using illegal drugs, such as cocaine, methamphetamines, and club drugs, during pregnancy can cause problems for both you and your baby. They may cause low birth weight babies, birth defects, or miscarriage. Your child may be more likely to have learning and developmental disabilities. And if you are injecting the drugs, that puts you at risk for HIV. HIV can be passed along to your baby during pregnancy.  Prescription drug misuse Misusing prescription drugs can also be harmful. Misuse can include taking more than your prescribed dose or taking it more often, using it to get high, or taking someone else's medicines. The possible effects of misusing a medicine during pregnancy will depend on which medicine you are misusing.  Opioids One type of drug that is a concern during pregnancy is opioids. Opioids include strong prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone, hydrocodone, fentanyl, and tramadol. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. Taking opioids during pregnancy can cause problems for you and your baby. The risks include birth defects, preterm birth, the loss of the baby, and neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS). NAS causes withdrawal symptoms in newborn babies.   If you have pain and your health care provider suggests that you take prescription opioids during pregnancy, first discuss the risks and benefits with the provider. Then if you both decide that you need to take the opioids, you can work together to try to minimize the risks.  Cannabis (marijuana) Cannabis (marijuana) is another drug that could be harmful to your baby. Some research shows that using cannabis during pregnancy is linked to developmental problems in children and teens. More research is needed, but the safest thing to do is stop using it if you are pregnant. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises that people should not use cannabis while they are pregnant.  Getting help If you are pregnant and using any of these substances, contact your provider. Together you and your provider can find the right treatment to help you quit.  If you are taking opioids or are addicted to drugs, don't stop taking them suddenly. That can be dangerous to you and the baby. Instead, contact your provider for help with getting off the drugs safely.",

Prenatal care can help keep you and your fetus healthy until you're ready to deliver your baby. It lets your provider spot health problems early. Early treatment can cure many problems and prevent others from developing.   Every prenatal visit offers you the chance to ask questions about having a healthy pregnancy and preparing for delivery.

    "disease": "Prescription Drug Misuse",
    "summary": "What is prescription drug misuse? If you take a medicine in a different way than your health care provider prescribed, it's called prescription drug misuse. It could be:  Taking medicine prescribed for someone else. Taking a larger dose than you are supposed to. Taking the medicine in a different way than you are supposed to. For example, instead of swallowing your tablets, you might crush them and then snort or inject them.  Using the medicine for another purpose, such as getting high.   Misusing some prescription drugs can lead to addiction. These include opioids, sedatives, tranquilizers, and stimulants. Drug addiction is a chronic brain disease. It causes a person to take drugs repeatedly despite the harm they cause.   Who is at risk for prescription drug misuse? Prescription drug misuse can affect anyone at any age, including teenagers and older adults. It can happen if you need certain medicines to treat a medical condition, reduce pain after an injury or surgery, or for chronic pain.   Risk factors can include:  A lack of knowledge about the prescription drug and possible risks A previous addiction to other substances, including alcohol and tobacco Certain mental health conditions   What are the risks of prescription drug misuse? Prescription drug misuse can have serious medical consequences. Every medicine has some risk of side effects, which providers think about when prescribing medicines. People who misuse these drugs may not know the risks. Some medicines may not be safe for them, especially at higher doses or when taken with other medicines.   What are treatments for prescription drug misuse? Treatment for prescription drug misuse often includes medicines and counseling, but it depends on the type of drug and your needs.   The counseling may be individual, family, and/or group therapy. It can help you:  Understand why prescription drug misuse began Learn how to change unhealthy patterns of thinking and behavior Manage personal problems and develop positive relationships Learn how to manage cravings and avoid situations that could lead to a relapse   Stopping or cutting back on prescription drugs used for a while, may cause different symptoms for different drugs. This is called withdrawal. Your provider will work with you to manage the symptoms as your body gets used to being taken off the medicine.   How can I prevent problems with taking prescription drugs? Providers and pharmacists play a role in preventing or reducing prescription drug misuse, but you can also take steps to reduce your risk.   A few ways to help reduce your risk and make sure that you are using any prescription medicines correctly include:   Talk to your provider about any other prescription medicines, over-the-counter-medicines, and supplements that you're taking to see if it is safe to take the prescription drug with them. Follow the directions carefully and take medicine as prescribed. If you're taking prescription drugs for pain and it isn't working, don't stop or change the amount you're taking without talking to your provider. If your provider prescribes opioids, ask about the risks and benefits of taking the medicine, and if another medicine with less risk of addiction could be used.

    "disease": "Primary Ovarian Insufficiency",
    "summary": "What is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)? Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI), also known as premature ovarian failure, happens when a woman's ovaries stop working normally before she is 40.  Many women naturally experience reduced fertility when they are about 40 years old. They may start getting irregular menstrual periods as they transition to menopause. For women with POI, irregular periods and reduced fertility start before the age of 40. Sometimes it can start as early as the teenage years.  POI is different from premature menopause. With premature menopause, your periods stop before age 40. You can no longer get pregnant. The cause can be natural or it can be a disease, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation. With POI, some women still have occasional periods. They may even get pregnant.  In most cases of POI, the cause is unknown.  What causes primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)? In about 90% of cases, the exact cause of POI is unknown.  Research shows that POI is related to problems with the follicles. Follicles are small sacs in your ovaries. Your eggs grow and mature inside them. One type of follicle problem is that you run out of working follicles earlier than normal. Another is that the follicles are not working properly. In most cases, the cause of the follicle problem is unknown. But sometimes the cause may be: Genetic disorders such as Fragile X syndrome and Turner syndrome A low number of follicles Autoimmune diseases, including thyroiditis and Addison disease  Chemotherapy or radiation therapy Metabolic disorders Toxins, such as cigarette smoke, chemicals, and pesticides   Who is at risk for primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)? Certain factors can raise a woman's risk of POI: Family history. Women who have a mother or sister with POI are more likely to have it. Genes. Some changes to genes and genetic conditions put women at higher risk for POI. For example, women Fragile X syndrome or Turner syndrome are at higher risk. Certain diseases, such as autoimmune diseases and viral infections Cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy Age. Younger women can get POI, but it becomes more common between the ages of 35-40.   What are the symptoms of primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)? The first sign of POI is usually irregular or missed periods. Later symptoms may be similar to those of natural menopause: Hot flashes Night sweats Irritability Poor concentration Decreased sex drive Pain during sex Vaginal dryness   For many women with POI, trouble getting pregnant or infertility is the reason they go to their health care provider.  What other problems can primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) cause? Since POI causes you to have lower levels of certain hormones, you are at greater risk for other health conditions, including: Anxiety and depression. Hormonal changes caused by POI can contribute to anxiety or lead to depression. Dry eye syndrome and eye surface disease. Some women with POI have one of these eye conditions. Both can cause discomfort and may lead to blurred vision. If not treated, these conditions can cause permanent eye damage. Heart disease. Lower levels of estrogen can affect the muscles lining the arteries and can increase the buildup of cholesterol in the arteries. These factors increase your risk of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Infertility. Low thyroid function. This problem also is called hypothyroidism. The thyroid is a gland that makes hormones that control your body's metabolism and energy level. Low levels of thyroid hormones can affect your metabolism and can cause very low energy, mental sluggishness, and other symptoms. Osteoporosis. The hormone estrogen helps keep bones strong. Without enough estrogen, women with POI often develop osteoporosis. It is a bone disease that causes weak, brittle bones that are more likely to break.   How is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) diagnosed? To diagnose POI, your health care provider may do: A medical history, including asking whether you have relatives with POI A pregnancy test, to make sure that you are not pregnant A physical exam, to look for signs of other disorders that could be causing your symptoms Blood tests, to check for certain hormone levels. You may also have a blood test to do a chromosome analysis. A chromosome is the part of a cell that contains genetic information. A pelvic ultrasound, to see whether or not the ovaries are enlarged or have multiple follicles   How is primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) treated? Currently, there is no proven treatment to restore normal function to a woman's ovaries.  But there are treatments for some of the symptoms of POI. There are also ways to lower your health risks and treat the conditions that POI can cause:  Hormone replacement therapy (HRT). HRT is the most common treatment. It gives your body the estrogen and other hormones that your ovaries are not making. HRT improves sexual health and decreases the risks for heart disease and osteoporosis. You usually take it until about age 50; that's about the age when menopause usually begins. Calcium and vitamin D supplements. Because women with POI are at higher risk for osteoporosis, you should take calcium and vitamin D every day. In vitro fertilization (IVF). If you have POI and you wish to become pregnant, you may consider trying IVF. Regular physical activity and a healthy body weight. Getting regular exercise and controlling your weight can lower your risk for osteoporosis and heart disease. Treatments for associated conditions. If you have a condition that is related to POI, it is important to treat that as well. Treatments may involve medicines and hormones.   NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development",

    "disease": "Progressive Supranuclear Palsy",
    "summary": "What is progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)? Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a rare brain disease. It happens because of damage to nerve cells in the brain. PSP affects your movement, including control of your walking and balance. It also affects your thinking and eye movement.   PSP is progressive, which means that it gets worse over time.  What causes progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)? The cause of PSP is unknown. In rare cases, the cause is a mutation in a certain gene.  One sign of PSP is abnormal clumps of tau in nerve cells in the brain. Tau is a protein in your nervous system, including in nerve cells. Some other diseases also cause a buildup of tau in the brain, including Alzheimer's disease.  Who is at risk for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)? PSP usually affects people over 60, but in some cases it can start earlier. It is more common in men.  What are the symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)? Symptoms are very different in each person, but they may include: A loss of balance while walking. This is often the first symptom. Speech problems Trouble swallowing A blurring of vision and problems controlling eye movement Changes in mood and behavior, including depression and apathy (a loss of interest and enthusiasm) Mild dementia   How is progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) diagnosed? There is no specific test for PSP. It can be difficult to diagnose, because the symptoms are similar to other diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease.  To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will take your medical history and do physical and neurological exams. You may have an MRI or other imaging tests.  What are the treatments for progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)? There is currently no effective treatment for PSP. Medicines may reduce some symptoms. Some non-drug treatments, such as walking aids and special glasses, may also help. People with severe swallowing problems may need gastrostomy. This is a surgery to insert a feeding tube into the stomach.  PSP gets worse over time. Many people become severely disabled within three to five years after getting it. PSP isn't life-threatening on its own. It can still be dangerous because it increases your risk of pneumonia, choking from swallowing problems, and injuries from falling. But with good attention to medical and nutritional needs, many people with PSP can live 10 or more years after the first symptoms of the disease.

    "disease": "Prostate Cancer",
    "summary": "What is prostate cancer? Cancer is a disease in which cells in the body grow out of control. Prostate cancer begins in the cells of the prostate. The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder. It makes fluid that is part of semen.    Prostate cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. It often grows very slowly. If it does not spread to other parts of the body, it may not cause serious problems. But sometimes prostate cancer can grow quickly and spread to other parts of the body. This kind of prostate cancer is serious.  What causes prostate cancer? Researchers don't know for sure what causes prostate cancer. They do know that it happens when there are changes in the genetic material (DNA).  Sometimes these genetic changes are inherited, meaning that you are born with them. There are also certain genetic changes that happen during your lifetime that can raise your risk of prostate cancer. But often the exact cause of these genetic changes is unknown.   Who is more likely to develop prostate cancer? Anyone who has a prostate can develop prostate cancer. But certain factors can make you more likely to develop it:  Age. Your chance of developing prostate cancer increases as you get older. Prostate cancer is rare in people under age 50.  Family health history. Your risk of prostate cancer is higher if you have a parent, sibling, or child who has or has had prostate cancer.   Race. African Americans are more likely to get prostate cancer.  They're also more likely to: \t \t\tGet prostate cancer at a younger age.  \t\tHave more serious prostate cancer. \t\tDie from prostate cancer.  \t    What are the symptoms of prostate cancer? Prostate cancer doesn't always cause symptoms, especially at first. If it does cause symptoms, they may include:  Problems urinating (peeing), such as: \t \t\tA urine stream that's weak, hard to start, or starts and stops \t\tSuddenly needing to urinate right away \t\tUrinating often, especially at night \t\tPain or burning when urinating \t\tBlood in your urine or semen \t  Pain in your lower back, hips, or pelvis that does not go away Painful ejaculation (the release of semen through the penis during orgasm)  But many of these symptoms may be from other common prostate problems that aren't cancer, such as an enlarged prostate.   You should discuss your prostate health with your health care provider if you:  Have symptoms that could be prostate cancer Have a high risk for developing prostate cancer Had a screening test that suggests you could have prostate cancer   What are prostate tests and how is prostate cancer diagnosed? Tests which check for prostate cancer include:   A digital rectal exam (DRE). In this exam, your provider feels your prostate for lumps or anything unusual by inserting a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum.  A prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test. A high PSA blood level may be a sign of prostate cancer. But many other things can cause high PSA levels, too.   Imaging tests. These tests may use ultrasound or MRI to make pictures of your prostate.   If these tests show that you might have prostate cancer, the next step is usually a prostate biopsy. A biopsy is the only way to diagnose prostate cancer.   During a biopsy, a doctor uses a hollow needle to remove some prostate tissue. The tissue is studied under a microscope to look for cancer cells.   What are the treatments for prostate cancer? Your treatment options usually depend on your age, your general health, and how serious the cancer is. Your treatment may include one or more options:   Observation,which is mostly used if you are older, your prostate cancer isn't likely to grow quickly, and you don't have symptoms or you have other medical conditions. Your doctor will keep checking on your cancer over time so to see whether you will need to start treatment for the cancer. There are two types of observation: \t \t\tWatchful waiting means having little or no testing. If symptoms begin or change, you will get treatment to relieve them, but not to treat the cancer.  \t\tActive surveillance means having regular tests to see if your prostate cancer has changed. If the tests show the cancer is starting to grow or if you develop symptoms, then you will have treatment to try to cure the cancer.   \t  Surgery to remove your prostate gland may be an option if your cancer hasn't spread outside of your prostate.  Radiation therapy uses high energy to kill cancer cells or prevent them from growing.  Hormone therapy blocks cancer cells from getting the hormones they need to grow. It may include taking medicines or having surgery to remove the testicles.  Chemotherapy uses medicines to kill cancer cells, slow their growth, or stop them from spreading. You might take the drugs by mouth, as an injection (shot), as a cream, or intravenously (by IV). Targeted therapy uses drugs or other substances that attack specific cancer cells. This treatment causes less harm to healthy cells than radiation therapy or chemotherapy. Immunotherapy helps your own immune system to fight cancer.   Can prostate cancer be prevented? Making healthy lifestyle changes may help to prevent some prostate cancers. These changes include:  Being at a healthy weight Quitting smoking Getting enough exercise Eating healthy foods   NIH: National Cancer Institute",

    "disease": "Prostate Cancer Screening",
    "summary": "What is cancer screening? Cancer is a disease when the cells of the body grow out of control. Cancer screening is having tests to look for signs of cancer before you have any symptoms. By the time cancer causes symptoms, it may have already spread to other parts of your body. A screening test may help find cancer early, when it may be easier to treat.  Cancer screening only tells you whether you might have cancer. It doesn't diagnose cancer. If a screening test shows signs of cancer, you'll need to have other tests to find out if you do have cancer and how serious it may be.    What is prostate cancer screening? Prostate cancer screening looks for signs of cancer in the prostate. The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder. It makes fluid that is part of semen.   Prostate cancer is most common in people over age 50. It usually grows slowly and doesn't cause health problems. In fact, it's possible to live a long life with prostate cancer and never know you have it. But in certain cases, prostate cancer may spread to other parts of the body and can be very serious. The goal of prostate cancer screening is to find prostate cancers that may be more likely to spread so they can be treated early.   What tests screen for prostate cancer? Two tests are commonly used to screen for prostate cancer:  A prostate-specific antigen test, also called a PSA blood test. PSA is a protein made by your prostate. A high level of PSA in your blood may mean you have prostate cancer, but it's not proof of cancer.  That's because many other things may cause high PSA levels, including:  \t\t \t\t\tHaving an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH) \t\t\tHaving other common prostate problems \t\t\tTaking certain medicines \t\t In general, the higher your PSA, the more likely it is that you have cancer. But a low PSA blood level isn't a guarantee that you don't have cancer.    Digital Rectal Examination (DRE). The DRE is a prostate exam.  In this exam, your health care provider inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum to feel your prostate for lumps or anything unusual. A DRE can check only one side of the prostate.   A PSA test or a DRE may be able to detect prostate cancer at an early stage. But it is not clear whether early detection and treatment lower the risk of dying from prostate cancer. You should talk with your provider about the benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening.  What are the possible benefits and harms of prostate cancer screening? The possible benefits of prostate cancer screening include:  Finding and treating prostate cancer early before it spreads  Getting a better sense of your prostate cancer risk (based on your PSA test)  Peace of mind if your screening shows you're unlikely to have prostate cancer now The option to choose further testing and closely monitor your prostate if your screening shows you may have cancer    The possible harms of prostate cancer screening include:  Getting a false positive result. This means that your PSA test shows you may have prostate cancer when you really don't. A false positive may lead to:  \t\t \t\t\tWorry while you have more tests to look for signs of cancer.  \t\t\tA prostate biopsy.  In a biopsy, a doctor removes tissue from your prostate so it can be studied under a microscope to look for cancer cells. This is the only way to diagnose cancer. The possible harms of a prostate biopsy include:\t \t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\tFever \t\t\t\t\tPain \t\t\t\t\tBlood in semen \t\t\t\t\tUrinary tract infection \t\t\t\t \t\t\t \t\t   Having prostate cancer treatment that you may not have needed. Prostate cancer screening may lead to a cancer diagnosis, but it's not always clear whether the cancer is likely to grow and spread. You could have unnecessary treatment for cancer that would never have caused any health problems. And the common prostate cancer treatments may have serious, permanent complications, such as:   \t\t \t\t\tUrinary incontinence  \t\t\tErectile dysfunction  \t\t\tProblems controlling your bowel movements (BMs) \t\t    Should I be screened for prostate cancer? Since there are benefits and risks to prostate screening, you should talk with your provider to decide if screening is right for you. You and your provider should consider:  Your age. The risk of prostate cancer increases after age 50. Your family health history. If members of your family have had prostate cancer, your risk may be higher. Your race. Prostate cancer is more common in African Americans.  They also have a higher risk of developing prostate cancer at a younger age and having more serious disease.  Your general health. Are you well enough to have treatment for prostate cancer if it's found?  What you prefer. How do you feel about the possible benefits and harms of screening, diagnosis, and treatment?

    "summary": "What is the prostate? The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder. It makes fluid that is part of semen.   What are prostate diseases? There are many types of prostate diseases:  Prostatitis is inflammation (swelling and pain) in the prostate gland. It's the most common type of prostate problem in people under than age 50. There are different types:  \t \t\tChronic prostatitis is also called chronic pelvic pain syndrome. It's the most common type of prostatitis.  \t\tAcute bacterial prostatitis starts suddenly from a bacterial infection and is treated with antibiotics. It is not common. \t\tChronic bacterial prostatitis happens when a bacterial infection keeps coming back. The symptoms usually start slowly. It may take longer to treat than acute bacterial prostatitis. \t\tAsymptomatic prostatitis has no symptoms and usually doesn't need treatment. You may learn you have it after having tests for other health problems.  \t  Enlarged prostate is also called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). The prostate gland tends to grow larger with age. That's why enlarged prostate is very common in older people and rare in those who are under age 40. When the prostate grows larger, it may press on your urethra and cause problems with urination. Prostate cancer happens when cancer cells form in the prostate gland. Prostate cancer is a common type of cancer in those aged 50 and older. Most prostate cancers grow slowly and may never cause health problems. But certain prostate cancers are serious.    Who is more likely to develop prostate diseases? Anyone with a prostate can develop prostate problems. But some people are at higher risk.  You may be more likely to develop prostatitis if you have:  A lower urinary tract infection, also called a UTI. An infection in your lower urinary tract (bladder and urethra) may lead to acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis.  Nerve damage in your lower urinary tract from surgery or an injury. This may lead to chronic prostatitis. Emotional stress, which can lead to chronic prostatitis.   You may be more likely to develop an enlarged prostate (BPH) if you:  Are age 40 or older. Have family members who have had BPH. Have certain health conditions such as: \t \t\tObesity. \t\tHeart disease and problems with blood circulation. \t\tType 2 diabetes. \t  Don't get enough physical activity.   You may be more likely to develop prostate cancer if you:  Are older than age 50. Have a parent, sibling, or child who has or had prostate cancer. Are African American.   What are the symptoms of prostate diseases? The symptoms of prostate problems include:  Needing to urinate a lot. Needing to rush to the bathroom, but not being able to urinate or only going a little. Leaking or dribbling urine. Having a weak urine stream.   Other symptoms depend on the type of prostate problem you have and may include:  Not being able to urinate at all. This is a medical emergency.   Any problems, starting or controlling urine flow. Waking up often to urinate.  Blood in your urine or urine that has an unusual smell or color. Fever, chills, or body aches. Great discomfort or pain: \t \t\tWhile urinating or after ejaculation. \t\tIn your abdomen (belly), between your scrotum and anus, or in your scrotum or penis. \t    Contact your provider if you have any of these symptoms.  How are prostate diseases diagnosed? To find out if you have a prostate problem, your provider will:  Ask about your medical history and symptoms. Ask about your family health history.  Do a physical exam. The exam may include a digital rectal exam (DRE) of your prostate. In a DRE, your provider inserts a gloved finger into your rectum to feel the general size and condition of your prostate.  Order tests, if needed. Tests may include: \t \t\tBlood and urine tests to look for infection. \t\tUrodynamic testing to see how well you can hold and release urine. \t\tCystoscopy to look inside your urethra and bladder. \t\tUltrasound pictures of your prostate and urinary tract. \t\tA PSA blood test (prostate-specific antigen test). \t\tProstate biopsy to diagnose or rule out cancer. \t    Treatment depends on what prostate disease you have and which symptoms bother you most.

    "summary": "What are pubic lice? Pubic lice (also called crabs) are tiny insects which usually live in the pubic or genital area of humans. They are also sometimes found on other coarse body hair, such as hair on the legs, armpits, mustache, beard, eyebrows, or eyelashes. Pubic lice on the eyebrows or eyelashes of children or teens may be a sign of sexual exposure or abuse.  Pubic lice are parasites, and they need to feed on human blood to survive. They are one of the three types of lice that live on humans. The other two types are head lice and body lice. Each type of lice is different, and getting one type does not mean that you will get another type.  How do pubic lice spread? Pubic lice move by crawling, because they cannot hop or fly. They usually spread through sexual contact. Occasionally, they may spread through physical contact with a person who has pubic lice, or through contact with clothing, beds, bed linens, or towels that were used by a person with pubic lice. You cannot get pubic lice from animals.  Who is at risk for pubic lice? Since they spread mainly through sexual contact, pubic lice are most common in adults.  What are the symptoms of pubic lice? The most common symptom of pubic lice is intense itching in the genital area. You may also see nits (lice eggs) or crawling lice.How do you know if you have pubic lice? A diagnosis of a pubic lice usually comes from seeing a louse or nit. But lice and nits can be difficult to find because there may be only a few present. Also, they often attach themselves to more than one hair, and they do not crawl as quickly as head and body lice. Sometimes it takes a magnifying lens to see the lice or nits.  People who have pubic lice should also be checked for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and their sexual partners should also be checked for pubic lice.  What are the treatments for pubic lice? The main treatment for pubic lice is a lice-killing lotion. Options include a lotion that contains permethrin or a mousse containing pyrethrins and piperonyl butoxide. These products are available over-the-counter without a prescription. They are safe and effective when you use them according to the instructions. Usually one treatment will get rid of the lice. If not, you may need another treatment after 9-10 days.   There are other lice-killing medicines that are available with a prescription from your health care provider.  You should also wash your clothes, bedding, and towels with hot water, and dry them using the hot cycle of the dryer.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

    "disease": "Pulmonary Embolism",
    "summary": "What is a pulmonary embolism (PE)? A pulmonary embolism (PE) is a sudden blockage in a lung artery. It usually happens when a blood clot breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. PE is a serious condition that can cause: Permanent damage to the lungs Low oxygen levels in your blood Damage to other organs in your body from not getting enough oxygen   PE can be life-threatening, especially if a clot is large, or if there are many clots.  What causes a pulmonary embolism (PE)? The cause is usually a blood clot that breaks loose and travels through the bloodstream to the lungs. The clot is usually a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a clot in the leg. In rare cases, material such as air bubbles, clumps of fat, or parts of a tumor can block the lung artery and cause PE.  Who is more likely to develop a pulmonary embolism (PE)? Anyone can get a pulmonary embolism (PE), but certain things can raise your risk of PE: Having surgery, especially joint replacement surgery. Certain medical conditions, including    Cancers  Heart diseases  Lung diseases  A broken hip or leg bone or other trauma   Hormone-based medicines, such as birth control pills or hormone replacement therapy. Pregnancy and childbirth. The risk is highest for about six weeks after childbirth. Not moving for long periods, such as being on bed rest, having a cast, or taking a long plane flight. Age. Your risk increases as you get older, especially after age 40. Family history and genetics. Certain genetic changes that can increase your risk of blood clots and PE. Obesity.   What are the symptoms of a pulmonary embolism (PE)? Symptoms of PE include:  Shortness of breath Rapid breathing Chest pain or discomfort, which usually gets worse when you cough or take a deep breath Increased heart rate Coughing up blood Very low blood pressure, lightheadedness, or fainting   Sometimes people with PE don't have any symptoms until they have serious complications, such as pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the arteries to your lungs).   How is a pulmonary embolism (PE) diagnosed? It can be difficult to diagnose PE. To find out if you have a PE, your health care provider will: Take your medical history, including asking about your symptoms and risk factors for PE Do a physical exam Likely order some tests, including various imaging and blood tests   What are the treatments for a pulmonary embolism (PE)? If you have PE, you need medical treatment right away. The goal of treatment is to break up clots and help keep other clots from forming. Treatment options include medicines and procedures.  Medicines: Anticoagulants, or blood thinners, keep blood clots from getting larger and stop new clots from forming. You might get them as an injection, a pill, or through an I.V. (intravenous). They can cause bleeding, especially if you are taking other medicines that also thin your blood, such as aspirin. Thrombolytics are medicines to dissolve blood clots. You may get them if you have large clots that cause severe symptoms or other serious complications. Thrombolytics can cause sudden bleeding, so they are used if your PE is serious and may be life-threatening.   Procedures: Catheter-assisted thrombus removal uses a flexible tube to reach a blood clot in your lung. Your health care provider can insert a tool in the tube to break up the clot or to deliver medicine through the tube. Usually you will get medicine to put you to sleep for this procedure. A vena cava filter may be used in some people who cannot take blood thinners. Your health care provider inserts a filter inside a large vein called the vena cava. The filter catches blood clots before they travel to the lungs, which prevents pulmonary embolism. But the filter does not stop new blood clots from forming.   Can pulmonary embolism (PE) be prevented? Preventing new blood clots can prevent PE. Prevention may include: Continuing to take blood thinners. It's also important to get regular checkups with your provider, to make sure that the dosage of your medicines is working to prevent blood clots but not causing bleeding. Heart-healthy lifestyle changes, such as heart-healthy eating, exercise, and, if you smoke, quitting smoking. Using compression stockings to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Moving your legs when sitting for long periods of time (such as on long trips). Moving around as soon as possible after surgery or being confined to a bed.

    "disease": "Pulmonary Hypertension",
    "summary": "What is pulmonary hypertension?  Pulmonary hypertension, sometimes called PH, is a serious condition that affects the blood vessels in the lungs. It develops when the blood pressure in your lungs is higher than normal.  Your heart pumps blood to your lungs so they can add oxygen to the blood. The blood goes back to your heart. From there, it travels to the rest of your body so that your tissues can get the oxygen that they need.  The blood moves from your heart to your lungs through blood vessels called pulmonary arteries. If the pulmonary arteries become damaged, narrowed, or blocked, the blood does not flow through them as well. This can increase the blood pressure in the arteries and cause pulmonary hypertension.  There are different types of pulmonary hypertension, including pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The different types are based on what caused the disease.  What causes pulmonary hypertension? Pulmonary hypertension can develop on its own or be caused by another condition. Sometimes the cause is unknown or is not clear.  Some of the possible causes include:  Heart diseases, including left-sided heart failure and congenital heart disease Lung diseases such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), interstitial lung disease, emphysema, and sleep apnea Other medical conditions such as:      Liver diseases   Sickle cell disease   Pulmonary embolism (blood clots in the lungs)   Connective tissue disorders like scleroderma       Who is more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension?  Certain factors can make you more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension, such as:  Your age. The risk increases as you get older. The condition is usually diagnosed between ages 30 and 60. Your environment. Being exposed to asbestos or having certain infections caused by parasites can raise your risk. Your family history and genetics. Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, congenital heart disease, and Gaucher disease, can raise your risk of pulmonary hypertension. So can a family history of blood clots. Your lifestyle habits. Smoking and illegal drug use can raise your risk of developing pulmonary hypertension. Certain medicines. For example, some medicines used to treat cancer and depression can make you more likely to develop pulmonary hypertension. Your sex. Pulmonary hypertension is more common in women than in men.   What are the symptoms of pulmonary hypertension? The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension are sometimes hard to recognize and are similar to the symptoms of other medical conditions. So sometimes it can take years for someone to get diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension.  The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension may include:  Shortness of breath Chest pain or pressure Dizziness that may lead to fainting Fatigue Swelling of the abdomen, legs, or feet Heart palpitations (the feeling that your heart is pounding or beating too fast)   What other problems can pulmonary hypertension cause? Pulmonary hypertension can get worse over time and lead to serious problems, including:  Anemia, which can cause your body to not get enough oxygen-rich blood Arrhythmias, problems with the rate or rhythm of your heartbeat Blood clots in the pulmonary arteries Bleeding in the lungs Heart failure Liver damage Pericardial effusion, a collection of fluid around the heart Serious pregnancy complications   How is pulmonary hypertension diagnosed? To find out if you have pulmonary hypertension, your health care provider:  Will ask about your medical history and symptoms Will do a physical exam, which may include checking your blood oxygen, listening to your heart and lungs, and checking your blood pressure Will likely order some tests, such as:      Blood tests to look for blood clots, stress on the heart, or anemia   Heart imaging tests, such as a cardiac MRI   Lung imaging tests, such as chest x-ray   An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)       What are the treatments for pulmonary hypertension? Often there is no cure for pulmonary hypertension, but treatments can help manage your symptoms. Your provider will work with you to come up with a treatment plan. It will be based on your needs and the cause of the pulmonary hypertension. The plan may include:  Healthy lifestyle changes, such as:      Healthy eating, which includes eating less salt   Regular physical activity, which may be done through pulmonary rehabilitation     Medicines, such as:      Blood thinners   Medicines to control the rate blood is pumped throughout the body   Medicines to relax blood vessels and allow the blood to flow better   Medicine to reduce swelling (diuretics)     Oxygen therapy Procedures to reduce pressure in the heart or pulmonary artery In some severe cases, a lung transplant   NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "disease": "Pulmonary Rehabilitation",
    "summary": "What is pulmonary rehabilitation? Pulmonary rehabilitation, also known as pulmonary rehab or PR, is a program for people who have chronic (ongoing) breathing problems. It can help improve your ability to function and quality of life. PR does not replace your medical treatment. Instead, you use them together.  PR is often an outpatient program that you do in a hospital or clinic. Some people have PR in their homes. You work with a team of health care providers to find ways to lessen your symptoms, increase your ability to exercise, and make it easier to do your daily activities.  Who needs pulmonary rehabilitation? Your health care provider may recommend pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) if you have a chronic lung disease or another condition that makes it hard for you to breathe and limits your activities. For example, PR may help you if you: Have COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). The two main types are emphysema and chronic bronchitis. In COPD, your airways (tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs) are partially blocked. This makes it hard to get air in and out. Have an interstitial lung disease such as sarcoidosis and pulmonary fibrosis. These diseases cause scarring of the lungs over time. This makes it hard to get enough oxygen. Have cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an inherited disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to collect in the lungs and block the airways. Need lung surgery. You may have PR before and after lung surgery to help you prepare for and recover from the surgery. Have a muscle-wasting disorder that affects the muscles used for breathing. An example is muscular dystrophy.   PR works best if you start it before your disease is severe. However, even people who have advanced lung disease can benefit from PR.  What does pulmonary rehabilitation include? When you first start pulmonary rehabilitation (PR), your team of health care providers will want to learn more about your health. You will have lung function, exercise, and possibly blood tests. Your team will go over your medical history and current treatments. They may check on your mental health and ask about your diet. Then they will work together to create a plan that is right for you. It may include: Exercise training. Your team will come up with an exercise plan to improve your endurance and muscle strength. You will likely have exercises for both your arms and legs. You might use a treadmill, stationary bike, or weights. You may need to start slowly and increase your exercise as you get stronger. Nutritional counseling. Being either overweight or underweight can affect your breathing. A nutritious eating plan can help you work towards a healthy weight. Education about your disease and how to manage it. This includes learning how to avoid situations that make your symptoms worse, how to avoid infections, and how/when to take your medicines. Techniques you can use to save your energy. Your team may teach you easier ways to do daily tasks. For example, you may learn ways to avoid reaching, lifting, or bending. Those movements make it harder to breathe, since they use up energy and make you tighten your abdominal muscles. You may also learn how to better deal with stress, since stress can also take up energy and affect your breathing. Breathing strategies. You will learn techniques to improve your breathing. These techniques may increase your oxygen levels, decrease how often you take breaths, and keep your airways open longer. Psychological counseling and/or group support. It can feel scary to have trouble breathing. If you have a chronic lung disease, you are more likely to have depression, anxiety, or other emotional problems. Many PR programs include counseling and/or support groups. If not, your PR team may be able to refer you to an organization that offers them.   NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "summary": "What are the health risks of smoking tobacco? Quitting smoking is important for your health. Besides being the leading cause of cancer in the United States, smoking tobacco harms most organs of your body and causes many other health problems.   Tobacco smoke contains many chemicals and can even be harmful even if you don't smoke. Exposure to secondhand smoke can increase the risk of cancer and other diseases. If you're pregnant, it can harm your fetus.  It can be difficult to quit smoking. That's because smoking also causes addiction to nicotine, a stimulant drug in tobacco. Nicotine addiction makes it harder to stop, but quitting smoking can improve the quality and length of your life.  What are the benefits of quitting smoking? Tobacco use is the most common preventable cause of death. The more years you smoke and the more cigarettes you smoke each day, the higher your risk. Quitting smoking can help reduce your risk of health problems as well as improve the quality of your life.    Some initial benefits of quitting include:  Lower heart rate and blood pressure Less carbon monoxide in the blood (carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen) Better circulation Less coughing and wheezing Sense of smell and taste return  In the long term, quitting tobacco can help you live a longer life. Your risk of getting cancer decreases with each year you stay smoke-free.  How can I quit smoking? There are many ways to quit smoking. Common methods used to help quit smoking include:  Counseling with a health care provider about your smoking habits, readiness to quit, and setting a quit date. Smoking aids such as nicotine replacement products or medicines to help reduce nicotine addiction. These may not be right for you if you are pregnant, breastfeeding, a teenager, or if you have certain medical issues or take certain medicines.  Smoking reduction by slowly reducing the number of cigarettes per day, or stopping smoking altogether, often called \"cold turkey.\"   You may need to try different things, but a mixture of counseling and quit-smoking medicine has been shown to be the best method.  Some people think that switching to e-cigarettes can help to quit smoking, but that has not been proven. These battery-operated smoking devices look like cigarettes but work differently. Using an e-cigarette is called vaping. Researchers still have a lot to learn about the health effects of using e-cigarettes.  When you stop or cut back on smoking, you may have short-term effects such as irritability, anxiety, moodiness, weight gain, or trouble sleeping. These are called withdrawal symptoms. You can work with your provider to help reduce these symptoms and find the best way for you to quit.   NIH: National Cancer Institute",

    "summary": "What is radiation? Radiation is energy. It travels in the form of energy waves or high-speed particles. Radiation can occur naturally or be man-made. There are two types: Non-ionizing radiation, which includes radio waves, cell phones, microwaves, infrared radiation and visible light Ionizing radiation, which includes ultraviolet radiation, radon, x-rays, and gamma rays   What are the sources of radiation exposure? Background radiation is all around us all the time. Most of it forms naturally from minerals. These radioactive minerals are in the ground, soil, water, and even our bodies. Background radiation can also come from outer space and the sun. Other sources are man-made, such as x-rays, radiation therapy to treat cancer, and electrical power lines.  What are the health effects of radiation exposure? Radiation has been around us throughout our evolution. So our bodies are designed to deal with the low levels we're exposed to every day. But too much radiation can damage tissues by changing cell structure and damaging DNA. This can cause serious health problems, including cancer.  The amount of damage that exposure to radiation can cause depends on several factors, including: The type of radiation The dose (amount) of radiation How you were exposed, such as through skin contact, swallowing or breathing it in, or having rays pass through your body Where the radiation concentrates in the body and how long it stays there How sensitive your body is to radiation. A fetus is most vulnerable to the effects of radiation. Infants, children, older adults, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems are more vulnerable to health effects than healthy adults.   Being exposed to a lot of radiation over a short period of time, such as from a radiation emergency, can cause skin burns. It may also lead to acute radiation syndrome (ARS, or \"radiation sickness\").  The symptoms of ARS include headache and diarrhea. They usually start within hours. Those symptoms will go away and the person will seem healthy for a little while. But then they will get sick again. How soon they get sick again, which symptoms they have, and how sick they get depends on the amount of radiation they received. In some cases, ARS causes death in the following days or weeks.  Exposure to low levels of radiation in the environment does not cause immediate health effects. But it can slightly increase your overall risk of cancer.  What are the treatments for acute radiation sickness? Before they start treatment, health care professionals need to figure out how much radiation your body absorbed. They will ask about your symptoms, do blood tests, and may use a device that measures radiation. They also try get more information about the exposure, such as what type of radiation it was, how far away you were from the source of the radiation, and how long you were exposed.  Treatment focuses on reducing and treating infections, preventing dehydration, and treating injuries and burns. Some people may need treatments that help the bone marrow recover its function. If you were exposed to certain types of radiation, your provider may give you a treatment that limits or removes the contamination that is inside your body. You may also get treatments for your symptoms.  How can radiation exposure be prevented? There are steps you can take to prevent or reduce radiation exposure: If your health care provider recommends a test that uses radiation, ask about its risks and benefits. In some cases, you may be able to have a different test that does not use radiation. But if you do need a test that uses radiation, do some research into the local imaging facilities. Find one that monitors and uses techniques to reduce the doses they are giving patients. Reduce electromagnetic radiation exposure from your cell phone. At this time, scientific evidence has not found a link between cell phone use and health problems in humans. More research is needed to be sure. But if you still have concerns, you can reduce how much time you spend on your phone. You can also use speaker mode or a headset to place more distance between your head and the cell phone. If you live in a house, test the radon levels, and if you need to, get a radon reduction system. During a radiation emergency, get inside a building to take shelter. Stay inside, with all of the windows and doors shut. Stay tuned to and follow the advice of emergency responders and officials.   Environmental Protection Agency",

    "summary": "What is radiation therapy? Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment. It uses high doses of radiation to kill cancer cells and stop them from spreading. It may also be used for easing cancer symptoms. Radiation therapy may damage healthy cells. They can usually repair themselves more easily than cancer cells.  You may need days or weeks of treatment before the radiation starts killing cancer cells. But cancer cells should keep dying for weeks or months after your treatment ends.   When is radiation therapy used for cancer treatment? Radiation therapy treats many types of cancer. It may be used at different times or for different reasons during your treatment. Sometimes radiation is used with other treatments, like surgery, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy.   How is radiation therapy given? You may get radiation therapy once a day or in smaller doses twice a day for a few weeks. The radiation may be external, from special machines, or internal from radioactive substances placed inside your body.

    "disease": "Radon",
    "summary": "What is radon? Radon is a naturally occurring radioactive gas. It is invisible and has no odor or taste. It comes from the normal decay of uranium and thorium. These are two chemical elements that can be found in soil, rock, and groundwater. Radon breaks down quickly, giving off radioactive particles. Over time, breathing in high levels of these particles can cause lung cancer.  How would I be exposed to radon? Outdoors, there are low levels of radon in the air. But radon can also be indoors. It can enter homes and buildings through cracks in the floors, walls, or foundations. Certain building materials can give off radon. And sometimes radon gets inside through well water.  Radon levels can be higher in homes and buildings that are well insulated, tightly sealed, and/or built on soil that has a lot of uranium and thorium. Basements and first floors usually have the highest radon levels because they are closer to the ground.  How does radon cause lung cancer? When you breathe in radon, its radioactive decay products can get trapped in your lungs. They can damage the cells that line your lungs. Over time, it can lead to lung cancer. It may take years before this happens.  Radon is the second leading cause of lung cancer deaths after cigarette smoking. If you smoke and are exposed to radon, your risk of lung cancer is much higher than if you did not smoke. Most radon-related cancer deaths happen in smokers.  How do I know if my home has high levels of radon? Testing is the only way to know if there are high levels of radon in your home. You should test your home's radon levels:  If it's never been tested or the radon levels are unknown When preparing to buy or sell your house Before and after any renovations, especially after making any repairs to reduce radon levels Before making any lifestyle changes in the home that would cause someone to spend more time in the basement or lower level (such as converting a basement to a bedroom)    Testing is fairly inexpensive and easy to do. You can buy a test kit at most hardware stores or hire someone to do a test. It's a good idea to first contact a state or local radon official for advice. They can explain the differences between testing devices and recommend the most appropriate test for your needs. They can also give you a list of qualified radon testers.  There are both long- and short-term test kits:  Short-term kits measure radon for 2-90 days for quick results  Long-term kits measure radon in your home for over 90 days   Radon levels can vary from day to day and month to month. So a long-term test will give a better estimate of your average radon level.  How can I lower the radon level in my home? If the testing shows that you have an unsafe level of radon in your home, you can have a radon reduction system installed. It can bring the amount of radon down to a safe level. The cost of the system will depend on the size and design of your home.  You can also take some other steps to reduce radon levels in your home:  Increase air flow in your house by opening windows and using fans and vents to circulate air. But this will only temporarily reduce the radon levels.  Seal cracks in floors and walls with plaster, caulk, or other materials designed for this purpose.  After any fixes, monitor the radon levels to make sure that they are lower.",

    "disease": "Raynaud Phenomenon",
    "summary": "What is Raynaud phenomenon?  Raynaud phenomenon is a condition that affects your blood vessels (the tubes that your blood flows through). It causes your blood vessels to narrow, which decreases blood flow. This is called a Raynaud episode or \"attack.\" The attacks usually affect your fingers and toes, causing them to become cold and numb. They may also change color, usually to white or blue. These attacks happen in response to cold temperatures or stress.  Raynaud phenomenon may also be called Raynaud disease or Raynaud syndrome.  What are the types of Raynaud phenomenon? There are two types of Raynaud phenomenon:  Primary Raynaud phenomenon is the more common type. Its cause is unknown. Secondary Raynaud phenomenon is usually caused by another disease or problem, such as lupus or scleroderma. Other causes may be exposure to cold or certain chemicals. The type can be more serious than the primary type.   What causes Raynaud phenomenon? Researchers don't know exactly why some people develop Raynaud phenomenon. But they do understand how the attacks happen. When you are exposed to cold, your body tries to slow the loss of heat and maintain its temperature. To do this, the blood vessels in the top layer of your skin constrict (narrow). This moves blood from those vessels near the surface to vessels deeper in the body. But when you have Raynaud phenomenon, the blood vessels in your hands and feet react to cold or stress by narrowing quickly. They also stay narrowed for a long time.  Who is more likely to develop Raynaud phenomenon?  Anyone can develop Raynaud phenomenon, but some people are more likely to develop it:  Primary Raynaud phenomenon has been linked to:      Your sex. Women get it more often than men.   Your age. It usually develops in people younger than age 30. It often starts in the teenage years.   A family history of Raynaud phenomenon. You are more likely to develop Raynaud phenomenon if you have a family member who has it.     Secondary Raynaud phenomenon has been linked to:      Certain diseases. These include lupus, scleroderma, rheumatoid arthritis (RA), carpal tunnel syndrome, and connective tissue disorders.   Certain medicines. Medicines that treat high blood pressure, migraines, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may cause similar symptoms to Raynaud phenomenon or make your symptoms worse.   Work-related exposures, such as repeated use of vibrating machinery (such as a jackhammer), or exposure to cold or certain chemicals.       What are the symptoms of Raynaud phenomenon? Raynaud attacks most often happen when you get cold, for example when you grab something cold from the freezer or go into an air-conditioned building on a warm day. Attacks usually affect your fingers and toes. But sometimes they can affect other parts of your body, such as your ears, nose, lips, or nipples.  An attack causes the skin to become cold and numb. Your skin may also turn white or blue due to a lack of oxygen. As the blood flow returns, your skin may tingle, throb, or turn red. An attack may last a few minutes or a few hours. If you have darker skin, you may not be able to easily see the skin color changes.  For many people, especially those with the primary type, the symptoms are mild. People with the secondary type often have more severe symptoms. They may develop skin ulcers (open sores caused by poor blood flow) or skin infections.  How is Raynaud phenomenon diagnosed? There is no specific test to diagnose Raynaud phenomenon. To find out if you have it, your health care provider:  Will take your medical history and ask about your symptoms. Will do a physical exam. May order blood and other lab tests to check for other conditions which could be causing your symptoms and/or to help decide which type of Raynaud phenomenon you have.   What are the treatments for Raynaud phenomenon? Most people with Raynaud phenomenon can keep their symptoms under control by avoiding getting cold. But if this is not enough, medicines and, in some cases, surgical procedures can help.  Secondary Raynaud phenomenon is more likely to be serious and to need more treatments. It's also important to treat the condition or problem that is causing your Raynaud phenomenon.   You may need to see a specialist such as a rheumatologist, a doctor who treats diseases of the joints, muscles, and bones.  Can Raynaud phenomenon be prevented? Raynaud phenomenon cannot be prevented, but you can help prevent attacks and manage your symptoms by:  Placing your hands or feet in a warm place when you have an attack. This could mean putting them under warm (not hot) water or under a heating pad. Keeping your body, especially your hands and feet, warm in cold weather. Avoiding triggers, such as certain medicines and stress. Quitting smoking (or not starting smoking). Managing stress.   NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases",

    "disease": "Reflux in Children",
    "summary": "What is reflux (GER) and GERD? Gastroesophageal reflux (GER), often called reflux, occurs when food or stomach acid flows back from your child's stomach into the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. This can sometimes cause irritation or a burning sensation. Occasional reflux is common and usually not a problem.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a more serious and long-lasting type of reflux. GERD can cause repeated symptoms or damage to the lining of the esophagus. Having reflux two or more times a week may be a sign of GERD. Your child's health care provider may diagnose GERD if the reflux causes pain, feeding problems, or irritation of the esophagus.    What causes reflux and GERD in children? A small muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter acts as a valve between the esophagus and stomach. When your child swallows, this muscle relaxes to let food pass from the esophagus to the stomach. This muscle normally stays closed, so the stomach contents and acid don't flow back into the esophagus. This muscle, along with the diaphragm (the large muscle between the chest and abdomen), usually prevents reflux. It's normal for children to have reflux occasionally.   In children who have GERD, the lower esophageal sphincter may be weak or relax when it shouldn't. That allows stomach contents into the esophagus. This can happen because of:   A hiatal hernia, a condition in which the upper part of the stomach pushes up into the chest Increased pressure on the abdomen (belly) from being overweight or having obesity Certain medicines, such as some used to treat asthma, allergies, depression, or pain Smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke Previous surgery on the esophagus or upper abdomen Developmental delays or certain neurological conditions, such as cerebral palsy Lung conditions, such as cystic fibrosis   How common are reflux and GERD in children? Many children have occasional reflux, especially after large meals or physical activity. GERD is less common, and most symptoms improve with time and lifestyle changes.   What are the symptoms of reflux and GERD in children? Symptoms may vary by age. Some children might not even notice reflux, while others may taste food or stomach acid in the back of their mouth.   In children, GERD can cause:  Heartburn, a burning feeling in the chest or throat (more common in older children and teens) Bad breath Nausea or vomiting Trouble or pain when swallowing  Cough, hoarseness, or breathing problems Wearing away of tooth enamel from stomach acid   Other conditions can cause similar symptoms. Talk to your child's provider if symptoms happen often or make eating, sleeping, or daily activities difficult.  How are reflux and GERD diagnosed in children? In most cases, your child's provider can tell if it's reflux by learning about your child's symptoms and health history. Tests are usually needed only if symptoms don't get better with lifestyle changes or medicines, or if another health problem is suspected.  Common tests include:  Upper GI series, which looks at the shape of your child's upper GI (gastrointestinal) tract. Your child will drink or eat a chalky-tasting liquid called barium. For young children, the barium is mixed in with a bottle or other food. Several x-rays are taken to track the barium as it goes through your child's esophagus and stomach.  Esophageal pH and impedance monitoring, which measures the amount of acid or liquid in your child's esophagus. A thin flexible tube is placed through their nose into the stomach. The end of the tube in the esophagus measures when and how much acid comes up into the esophagus. The other end of the tube attaches to a monitor that records the measurements. Your child will wear the tube for 24 hours. They may need to stay in the hospital during the test. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and biopsy, which uses an endoscope, a long, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end of it. An endoscope is inserted down your child's esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine. While looking at the pictures from the endoscope, tissue samples (biopsy) may be taken.    What lifestyle changes can help treat my child's reflux or GERD? Simple lifestyle changes can often improve symptoms. Examples include:  Maintaining a healthy weight. Eating smaller meals. Avoiding high-fat foods or other trigger foods that cause symptoms. Wearing loose-fitting clothing around the abdomen (belly). Staying upright for 3 hours after meals and avoiding slouching when sitting. Sleeping with the head of the bed raised 6 to 8 inches.    What are the treatments for my child's GERD? If lifestyle changes aren't enough, your provider may recommend medicine to reduce stomach acid. The medicines work by lowering the amount of acid your child's stomach makes. Some are available over-the-counter, while others need a prescription. Do not give your child any medicine unless your provider recommends it.  If symptoms don't get better or are severe, your provider may refer you to a doctor who treats stomach and digestion problems in children. In rare cases, surgery may be considered. If GERD isn't treated, it can cause problems such as inflammation or scarring in the esophagus, changes in its lining (Barrett's esophagus), or make breathing problems, like asthma, worse. \t  NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

    "disease": "Reflux in Infants",
    "summary": "What is reflux (GER) and GERD? Gastroesophageal reflux (GER), often called reflux or spitting up, happens when food or milk comes back up from your baby's stomach into the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. Reflux is very common in healthy babies. It usually starts to get better by 6 months of age and goes away by 12 months. Reflux that continues after 18 months is unusual.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a more serious and long-lasting type of reflux. It can cause feeding problems, discomfort, or other symptoms that affect your baby's growth or sleep. Babies may have GERD if symptoms prevent them from feeding well or last longer than 12 to 14 months.  What causes reflux and GERD in infants? There is a muscle (the lower esophageal sphincter) that acts as a valve between the esophagus and stomach. When your baby swallows, this muscle relaxes to let food pass from the esophagus to the stomach. This muscle normally stays closed, so the stomach contents don't flow back into the esophagus. In babies who have reflux, this muscle is not fully developed and lets the stomach contents back up the esophagus. This causes your baby to spit up (regurgitate). As your baby grows and the sphincter muscle fully develops, your baby should no longer spit up. In babies who have GERD, the sphincter muscle becomes weak or relaxes when it shouldn't. This allows stomach contents to come up more often or cause irritation.  How common are reflux and GERD in infants? Reflux is very common in babies and usually goes away on its own. Most babies spit up several times a day during their first 3 months. They usually stop spitting up between the ages of 12 and 14 months.  GERD is less common. Babies may show symptoms, but they decrease with growth, with only a small number of babies affected by 12 months.  Babies are more likely to have reflux or GERD if they:   Were born too early (premature) Have lung problems, such as cystic fibrosis Have conditions that affect the nervous system, such as cerebral palsy Have a hiatal hernia (when part of the stomach pushes up into the chest) Have had surgery on the esophagus    What are the symptoms of reflux and GERD in infants? In babies, the main symptom of reflux and GERD is spitting up. GERD may also cause symptoms such as:   Arching of the back, often during or right after eating Coughing Gagging or trouble swallowing Irritability or crying, especially after eating Poor eating or refusing to eat Not gaining enough weight or losing weight Wheezing or trouble breathing Forceful or frequent vomiting   Other conditions can cause similar symptoms. Contact your baby's health care provider if your baby has symptoms, especially if your baby isn't gaining weight.  How are reflux and GERD diagnosed in infants? In most cases, your provider diagnoses reflux by reviewing your baby's symptoms and medical history. Testing is only needed if symptoms don't get better with feeding changes or medicines, or if there are other health concerns. Several tests can help your provider diagnose GERD. Sometimes more than one test may be ordered to get a diagnosis. Common tests include:  Upper GI series, which looks at the shape of your baby's upper GI (gastrointestinal) tract. Your baby will drink or eat a chalky-tasting liquid called barium. The barium is mixed in with a bottle or other food. Several x-rays are taken to track the barium as it goes through your baby's esophagus and stomach.  Esophageal pH or impedance monitoring, which measures the amount of acid or liquid in your baby's esophagus. A thin flexible tube is placed through your baby's nose into the stomach. The end of the tube in the esophagus measures when and how much acid comes up into the esophagus. The other end of the tube attaches to a monitor that records the measurements. Your baby will wear this for 24 hours, most likely in the hospital. Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy and biopsy, which uses an endoscope, a long, flexible tube with a light and camera at the end of it. An endoscope is inserted down your baby's esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine. While looking at the pictures from the endoscope, tissue samples (biopsy) may be taken.   What feeding changes can help treat my infant's reflux or GERD? Simple feeding changes may help reduce your baby's reflux:  Add rice cereal to your baby's bottle of formula or breastmilk. Check with your provider about how much to add. If the mixture is too thick, you can change the nipple size or cut a little \"x\" in the nipple to make the opening larger.  Burp your baby after every 1 to 2 ounces of formula. If you breastfeed, burp your baby after nursing from each breast. Avoid overfeeding; give your baby the amount of formula or breast milk recommended. Hold your baby upright for 30 minutes after feedings. If you use formula and your provider thinks that your baby may be sensitive to milk protein, they may suggest switching to a different type of formula. Do not change formulas without talking to your provider.   What are the treatments for my infant's GERD? If feeding changes do not help enough, your provider may recommend medicines to reduce stomach acid. Medicines aren't usually needed, and are only suggested if your baby still has regular GERD symptoms and:   You have already tried some feeding changes Your baby has problems sleeping or feeding Your baby does not grow or gain weight properly   Acid-blocking medicines may be given for a short time to see if they help. You shouldn't give your baby any medicines unless your provider tells you to. If medicines don't help and your baby still has severe symptoms, your provider might talk to you about surgery. Surgery is rarely needed for babies with GERD. It may be considered only if reflux causes serious breathing problems or if your baby isn't gaining enough weight.

    "disease": "Refractive Errors",
    "summary": "What are refractive errors? The cornea and lens of your eye bend (refract) light rays to focus them on the retina. Refractive errors happen when the shape of your eye prevents light from focusing correctly on the retina. This causes blurry vision. Changes in the eye's shape affect how light rays bend and focus, leading to vision problems.   What causes refractive errors? Refractive errors can happen when:  The eyeball is too long or too short. The cornea changes shape. The lens becomes less flexible as you age.   Each type of refractive error is different, but they all make it hard to see clearly.  What are common refractive errors? Four common types of refractive errors include:  Nearsightedness (myopia), blurred vision when looking at faraway objects.  Farsightedness (hyperopia), blurred vision when looking at close-up objects.  Astigmatism, blurred or distorted vision at all distances, which can make night vision harder.  Presbyopia, difficulty seeing things up close because the lens becomes less flexible with age. It affects adults in middle age and older and often begins around age 45.     Who is at risk for refractive errors? Anyone can have refractive errors. It's the most common type of vision problem. You may be more likely to have one if other family members wear glasses or contact lenses.  Most types of refractive errors start in childhood or are present at birth. Presbyopia is different. Nearly everyone develops it as they age, typically starting around age 45.  What are the symptoms of refractive errors? Sometimes you may not notice vision changes right away, which is why regular eye exams are so important.   The most common symptom is blurred vision. Other symptoms may include:  Double vision Haziness Glare or halos around bright lights A need to squint to see clearly Headaches Eye strain or tired eyes Difficulty focusing when reading or using a computer   If you already wear glasses or contact lenses and notice these symptoms, you may need a new prescription. Tell your eye care specialist if your vision changes or if you have problems with your glasses or contact lenses  How are refractive errors diagnosed? An eye care specialist can diagnose refractive errors during a comprehensive eye exam. You'll be tested to see how well you can see at different distances, both with and without corrective lenses (glasses or contact lenses). Your provider may also use special eye drops to dilate (widen) your pupils to check for other eye conditions.  Different eye care specialists may be involved in your care. Here are some of the most common:  Ophthalmologists are medical doctors who treat eye diseases, prescribe glasses or contact lenses, and perform eye surgery. Optometrists perform eye exams, diagnose vision problems, and prescribe glasses or contact lenses. Opticians fit or adjust glasses or contact lenses based on a prescription from your eye care specialist.    How are refractive errors treated? Refractive errors are usually easy to correct with:  Glasses  Contact lenses Laser eye surgery, in some cases   Your eye care specialist can help choose the best treatment for your vision and lifestyle.

    "summary": "What is rehabilitation? Rehabilitation is care that can help you get back, keep, or improve abilities that you need for daily life. These abilities may be physical, mental, and/or cognitive (thinking and learning). You may have lost them because of a disease or injury, or as a side effect from a medical treatment. Rehabilitation can improve your daily life and functioning.  Who needs rehabilitation? Rehabilitation is for people who have lost abilities that they need for daily life. Some of the most common causes include: Injuries and trauma, including burns, fractures (broken bones), traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injuries Stroke Severe infections Major surgery Side effects from medical treatments, such as from cancer treatments Certain birth defects and genetic disorders Developmental disabilities Chronic pain, including back and neck pain   What are the goals of rehabilitation? The overall goal of rehabilitation is to help you get your abilities back and regain independence. But the specific goals are different for each person. They depend on what caused the problem, whether the cause is ongoing or temporary, which abilities you lost, and how severe the problem is. For example,: A person who has had a stroke may need rehabilitation to be able to dress or bathe without help  An active person who has had a heart attack may go through cardiac rehabilitation to try to return to exercising Someone with a lung disease may get pulmonary rehabilitation to be able to breathe better and improve their quality of life   What happens in a rehabilitation program? When you get rehabilitation, you often have a team of different health care providers helping you. They will work with you to figure out your needs, goals, and treatment plan. The types of treatments that may be in a treatment plan include:  Assistive devices, which are tools, equipment, and products that help people with disabilities move and function Cognitive rehabilitation therapy to help you relearn or improve skills such as thinking, learning, memory, planning, and decision making Mental health counseling Music or art therapy to help you express your feelings, improve your thinking, and develop social connections Nutritional counseling Occupational therapy to help you with your daily activities  Physical therapy to help your strength, mobility, and fitness Recreational therapy to improve your emotional well-being through arts and crafts, games, relaxation training, and animal-assisted therapy Speech-language therapy to help with speaking, understanding, reading, writing and swallowing  Treatment for pain Vocational rehabilitation to help you build skills for going to school or working at a job   Depending on your needs, you may have rehabilitation in the providers' offices, a hospital, or an inpatient rehabilitation center. In some cases, a provider may come to your home. If you get care in your home, you will need to have family members or friends who can come and help with your rehabilitation.",

They also include substances that affect the ability of couples to have healthy children. These substances may be chemical, physical, or biological. Some common types include: Alcohol    Chemicals such as pesticides Smoking Legal and illegal drugs Metals such as lead and mercury Radiation Some viruses   You may be exposed to reproductive hazards through contact with your skin, breathing them in, or swallowing them. This can happen anywhere, but it is more common in the workplace or at home.  What are the health effects of reproductive hazards? The possible health effects of reproductive hazards include infertility, miscarriage, birth defects, and developmental disabilities in children. What type of health effects they cause and how serious they are depends on many factors, including: What the substance is How much of it you are exposed to How it enters your body How long or how often you are exposed How you react to the substance   How can reproductive hazards affect men? For a man, a reproductive hazard can affect the sperm. A hazard may cause a problem with the number of sperm, their shape, or the way that they swim. It could also damage the sperm's DNA. Then the sperm may not be able to fertilize an egg. Or it could cause problems with the development of the fetus.  How can reproductive hazards affect women? For a woman, a reproductive hazard can disrupt the menstrual cycle. It can cause hormone imbalance, which can raise the risk of diseases such as osteoporosis, heart disease, and certain cancers. It can affect a woman's ability to get pregnant.  A woman who is exposed during pregnancy can have different effects, depending on when she was exposed. During the first 3 months of pregnancy, it might cause a birth defect or a miscarriage. During the last 6 months of pregnancy, it could slow the growth of the fetus, affect the development of its brain, or cause preterm labor.  How can reproductive hazards be avoided? To try to avoid reproductive hazards: Avoid alcohol and illegal drugs during pregnancy. If you smoke, try to quit. And if you are not a smoker, don't start. Take precautions if you are using household chemicals or pesticides. Use good hygiene, including handwashing. If there are hazards at your job, make sure to follow safe work practices and procedures.",

    "disease": "Respiratory Failure",
    "summary": "What is respiratory failure? Respiratory failure is a condition in which your blood doesn't have enough oxygen or has too much carbon dioxide. Sometimes you can have both problems.  When you breathe, your lungs take in oxygen. The oxygen passes into your blood, which carries it to your organs. Your organs, such as your heart and brain, need this oxygen-rich blood to work well.  Another part of breathing is removing the carbon dioxide from the blood and breathing it out. Having too much carbon dioxide in your blood can harm your organs.   What causes respiratory failure? Conditions that affect your breathing can cause respiratory failure. These conditions may affect the muscles, nerves, bones, or tissues that support breathing. Or they may affect the lungs directly. These conditions include: Diseases that affect the lungs, such as COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, and COVID-19 Conditions that affect the nerves and muscles that control breathing, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injuries, and stroke Problems with the spine, such as scoliosis (a curve in the spine). They can affect the bones and muscles used for breathing. Damage to the tissues and ribs around the lungs. An injury to the chest can cause this damage. Drug or alcohol overdose Inhalation injuries, such as from inhaling smoke (from fires) or harmful fumes   What are the symptoms of respiratory failure? The symptoms of respiratory failure depend on the cause and the levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in your blood.  A low oxygen level in the blood can cause shortness of breath and air hunger (the feeling that you can't breathe in enough air). Your skin, lips, and fingernails may also have a bluish color. A high carbon dioxide level can cause rapid breathing and confusion.  Some people who have respiratory failure may become very sleepy or lose consciousness. They also may have arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat). You may have these symptoms if your brain and heart are not getting enough oxygen.  How is respiratory failure diagnosed? Your health care provider will diagnose respiratory failure based on: Your medical history A physical exam, which often includes    Listening to your lungs to check for abnormal sounds  Listening to your heart to check for arrhythmia  Looking for a bluish color on your skin, lips, and fingernails   Diagnostic tests, such as    Pulse oximetry, a small sensor that uses a light to measure how much oxygen is in your blood. The sensor goes on the end of your finger or on your ear.  Arterial blood gas test, a test that measures the oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in your blood. The blood sample is taken from an artery, usually in your wrist.     Once you are diagnosed with respiratory failure, your provider will look for what is causing it. Tests for this often include a chest x-ray. If your provider thinks you may have arrhythmia because of the respiratory failure, you may have an EKG (electrocardiogram). This is simple, painless test that detects and records your heart's electrical activity.  What are the treatments for respiratory failure? Treatment for respiratory failure depends on: Whether it is acute (short-term) or chronic (ongoing) How severe it is What is causing it   Acute respiratory failure can be a medical emergency. You may need treatment in intensive care unit at a hospital. Chronic respiratory failure can often be treated at home. But if your chronic respiratory failure is severe, you might need treatment in a long-term care center.  One of the main goals of treatment is to get oxygen to your lungs and other organs and remove carbon dioxide from your body. Another goal is to treat the cause of the condition. Treatments may include: Oxygen therapy, through a nasal cannula (two small plastic tubes that go in your nostrils) or through a mask that fits over your nose and mouth Tracheostomy, a surgically-made hole that goes through the front of your neck and into your windpipe. A breathing tube, also called a tracheostomy, or trach tube, is placed in the hole to help you breathe. Ventilator, a breathing machine that blows air into your lungs. It also carries carbon dioxide out of your lungs. Other breathing treatments, such as noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV), which uses mild air pressure to keep your airways open while you sleep. Another treatment is a special bed that rocks back and forth, to help you breathe in and out. Fluids, often through an intravenous (IV), to improve blood flow throughout your body. They also provide nutrition.   Medicines for discomfort Treatments for the cause of the respiratory failure. These treatments may include medicines and procedures.   If you have respiratory failure, see your health care provider for ongoing medical care. Your provider may suggest pulmonary rehabilitation.  If your respiratory failure is chronic, make sure that you know when and where to get help for your symptoms. You need emergency care if you have severe symptoms, such as trouble catching your breath or talking. You should call your provider if you notice that your symptoms are worsening or if you have new signs and symptoms.  Living with respiratory failure may cause fear, anxiety, depression, and stress. Talk therapy, medicines, and support groups can help you feel better.   NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "disease": "Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections",
    "summary": "What is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV)?  Respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is a common respiratory virus. It usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms. But it can cause serious lung infections, especially in infants, older adults, and people with serious medical problems.   How is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) spread? RSV spreads from person to person through: The air by coughing and sneezing Direct contact, such as kissing the face of a child who has RSV Touching an object or surface with the virus on it, then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes before washing your hands  People who have an RSV infection are usually contagious for 3 to 8 days. But sometimes infants and people with weakened immune systems can continue to spread the virus for as long as 4 weeks.  Who is at risk for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections? RSV can affect people of all ages. But it is very common in small children; nearly all children become infected with RSV by age 2. In the United States, RSV infections usually occur during RSV season, which is usually fall through spring.  Certain people are at higher risk of having a severe RSV infection: Infants Older adults, especially those ages 65 and older People with chronic medical conditions such as heart or lung disease People with weakened immune systems  What are the symptoms of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections? The symptoms of RSV infection usually start about 4 to 6 days after infection. They include: Runny nose Decrease in appetite Cough Sneezing Fever Wheezing  These symptoms usually appear in stages instead of all at once. In very young infants, the only symptoms may be irritability, decreased activity, and trouble breathing. RSV can also cause more severe infections, especially in people at high risk. These infections include bronchiolitis, an inflammation of the small airways in the lung, and pneumonia, an infection of the lungs.  How are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, including asking about symptoms. A physical exam. A lab test of nasal fluid or another respiratory specimen to check for RSV. This is usually done for people with severe infection. Tests to check for complications in people with severe infection. The tests may include a chest x-ray and blood and urine tests.   What are the treatments for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections? There is no specific treatment for RSV infection. Most infections go away on their own in a week or two. Over-the-counter pain relievers can help with the fever and pain. However, do not give aspirin to children. And do not give cough medicine to children under four. It is also important to get enough fluids to prevent dehydration.  Some people with severe infection may need to be hospitalized. There, they might get oxygen, a breathing tube, or a ventilator.  Can respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections be prevented? There are some vaccines to protect against RSV illness. Two of them are for people ages 60 and older. If you are in this age group, talk to your provider about whether an RSV vaccine would be right for you.  If you are pregnant, there is a vaccine that is available to give between 32 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. It helps protect their newborn babies from RSV illness for the first 6 months of life.  There are two medicines to help prevent severe RSV illness in babies and young children. These medicines may help prevent severe RSV illness, but they can't cure or treat children who already have RSV. And they cannot prevent an RSV infection. Both medicines are given by injections (shots).  One medicine is given to infants who are younger than 8 months during their first RSV season. This includes infants who are born during RSV season. This medicine may also be given to some children between the ages of 8 and 19 months who are at high risk for severe RSV illness. For example, they might be at high risk because they:  Were born prematurely Have congenital heart disease Have chronic lung disease Have a weakened immune system   The other medicine is given monthly during RSV season. It is for children under 24 months of age who are at high risk for severe RSV illness.  There are also some steps you can take to lower your risk of getting or spreading an RSV infection, including: Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds Avoiding touching your face, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands Avoiding close contact, such as kissing, shaking hands, and sharing cups and eating utensils, with others if you are sick or they are sick Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue. Then throw away the tissue and wash your hands Staying home when sick        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

The retina senses light and sends signals to your brain so you can see.   Retinal disorders can cause blurred or distorted vision. Some can lead to vision loss or blindness.   What causes retinal disorders? The causes of retinal disorders vary. Aging is a common factor, but other things can raise your risk, such as if you:   Smoke  Have obesity  Have health conditions like diabetes or high blood pressure Have had an eye injury or trauma  Have a family history of retinal disorders   What are common retinal disorders? Some common retinal disorders include:   Macular degeneration. Occurs when the macula (the center of the retina that helps you see fine details) breaks down. There are two types: wet and dry macular degeneration.  Diabetic retinopathy. Occurs when diabetes damages small blood vessels in the retina, causing them to swell or leak. Retinal detachment. Occurs when the retina pulls away from the back of the eye. This is a medical emergency.  Retinal tears. A hole or break in the retina caused when the gel-like substance inside your eye (the vitreous) pulls away.  Retinoblastoma. A rare cancer of the retina that most often affects young children. Macular pucker. Scar tissue that forms on the macula and distorts vision. Macular hole. A small opening in the macula, often related to aging or injury. It can blur or distort central vision.  Eye floaters. Small specks, cobwebs, or threads that drift across your vision. These are more common with aging. Retina pigmentosa. A group of inherited disorders (passed down through families) that slowly damage the retina and cause loss of night and side (peripheral) vision.   What are the symptoms of retinal disorders? Symptoms can vary, but most retinal disorders affect your vision. Common symptoms include:   Blurred or distorted vision Loss of central or side (peripheral) vision Flashes of light  Seeing floating specks or cobwebs Trouble seeing at night Sudden vision loss (in severe cases)  Seek medical care right away if you notice flashes of light, sudden vision changes, or a sudden increase in eye floaters. These can be signs of a serious retinal problem.  How are retinal disorders diagnosed? Eye care providers check for retinal disorders with a dilated eye exam. Eye drops are used to widen your pupils so your provider can look at the retina for signs of damage.   They may also do other tests, such as:  Optical coherence tomography (OCT) to take detailed pictures of the inside of your eye. Fluorescein angiography to check the blood vessels in your retina. Visual field tests to measure your side (peripheral) vision.   How are retinal disorders treated? Some retinal disorders can be treated to slow or stop vision loss, and sometimes to restore vision. Treatment depends on the cause and severity. It may include:   Laser therapy  Medicine or eye injections  Surgery  Lifestyle management to control health conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure   Can retinal disorders be prevented? Not all retinal disorders can be prevented. Some are related to aging or genetics. But you can protect your eyes by:  Wearing safety goggles or sunglasses Getting regular eye exams   Making healthy lifestyle changes, such as:   Quitting smoking (or not starting) Managing diabetes and blood pressure      NIH: National Eye Institute",

Your blood type also has a positive or negative sign. This is called Rh factor, which is a protein. If your blood cells have this protein, you are Rh-positive. If you don't, you are Rh-negative.  Rh factor is inherited (passed down through families). Most people are Rh-positive, meaning they have the Rh factor. Rh-negative people don't have it. Being Rh-negative doesn't affect your health, but it can affect the health of your fetus if you are pregnant.    What is Rh incompatibility? If you are pregnant and are Rh-negative and your fetus is Rh-positive, it's called Rh incompatibility. Blood from your fetus can cross into your bloodstream, especially during childbirth. If you're Rh-negative and your baby is Rh-positive, your body will react to the fetus's blood as a foreign substance. It will create antibodies (proteins) that can damage their red blood cells. These antibodies usually don't cause problems during your first pregnancy. But Rh incompatibility may cause problems in later pregnancies if the fetus is Rh-positive. This is because the antibodies stay in your body once they have formed. During your next pregnancy, the antibodies can cross the placenta (the organ that grows in the uterus to provide oxygen and nutrients to the fetus) and attack the red blood cells of the fetus. Rh incompatibility can cause Rh disease, a serious condition that can cause a severe type of anemia.   How is Rh incompatibility diagnosed? Your health care provider will order blood tests during your first trimester of pregnancy. This is often done at your first prenatal visit. These tests can check if you have Rh factor and if your body has made antibodies.   How is Rh incompatibility treated?  During your pregnancy, injections of a medicine called Rh immune globulin can keep your body from making Rh antibodies. It helps prevent the problems of Rh incompatibility. After delivery, if your baby is born Rh-positive, you'll need another injection of the Rh immune globulin. But if you're Rh-negative and your baby is born Rh-negative, you don't need any other treatment. If treatment is needed for the baby, it may include phototherapy (light therapy) if treatment is needed for jaundice, supplements to help the body make red blood cells, or in severe cases a blood transfusion.   Can Rh incompatibility be prevented? Early prenatal care and treatment help prevent issues with Rh incompatibility.",

    "disease": "Rheumatoid Arthritis",
    "summary": "What is rheumatoid arthritis? Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a form of arthritis that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness in your joints. RA is an autoimmune disease. Although it is most common in the wrist and fingers, this disease can cause your immune system to attack any joint tissue. The inflammation (swelling) that comes with RA can also affect other body parts. Inflammation could cause medical issues in your eyes, skin, heart, nerves, blood, or lungs.  RA differs from osteoarthritis, a common arthritis that often comes with age. RA affects the lining of your joints and damages the tissue that covers the ends of the bones in a joint. Eventually, this might cause your joints to not work as well. There is no cure for RA, but early treatment can help you manage symptoms, reduce joint damage, and lead a productive life.   Who is more likely to get rheumatoid arthritis? Rheumatoid arthritis can happen at any age, but your risk increases as you become an older adult. Your chance of developing RA can also increase if:  You're a woman. Women are more likely to get RA than men.  You have a family history. If a member of your family has RA, you're more likely to get the disease.  You're a smoker. Smoking over a long period of time increases your risk of getting RA and how serious the disease can be.  You have other medical conditions that may increase your risk of getting RA. These include obesity, gum disease, and lung disease.   What causes rheumatoid arthritis?  No one knows what causes rheumatoid arthritis. A few things that might play a part in getting RA include:  Your genes are parts of DNA in your cells that are passed down from your parents. Certain genes may increase your risk of getting rheumatoid arthritis, but not everyone with these genes gets RA.  The environment, which includes things such as cigarette smoke, sometimes triggers RA symptoms. Hormones are chemical messengers in your bloodstream that control the actions of certain cells or organs. Researchers think that sex hormones might play a role in getting RA. Women are more likely to develop the disease, and RA symptoms may change during and after pregnancy.   What are the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis? Your immune system may start turning against your body's joints and tissues years before you notice any symptoms of RA. The changes from this type of immune malfunction usually settle in your joints.  RA affects people differently. You might have the disease for only a short time, or your symptoms might come and go. The severe form can be chronic (long-lasting) and may last a lifetime.   Symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis may include:   Joint pain or stiffness when moving. This is usually worse in the morning or after inactivity. RA usually affects both joints. If one of your hands or knees is affected, so is the other.  Joint tenderness, redness, and warmth.  Joint swelling may make daily activities hard. These could include things such as combing your hair, buttoning your clothes, or bending your knees. Fatigue, fever, and a loss of appetite. Hard bumps (rheumatoid nodules) under your skin near the joints.   How is rheumatoid arthritis diagnosed?\t There's no single test for rheumatoid arthritis. The disease develops over time. At first, you may only have a few symptoms, making it hard to diagnose RA in its early stages. To find out if you have RA, your health care provider may:  Ask about your medical history, including your symptoms. Ask about your family health history, including relatives who have had RA. Do a physical exam, which includes checking your joints, looking for rashes or nodules, and listening to your chest for signs of inflammation in your lungs. Order blood tests or imaging studies (x-ray or ultrasound) to make sure other health conditions aren't causing your symptoms since they may be like other types of arthritis and joint conditions.   Your provider may refer you to a rheumatologist (a doctor who specializes in arthritis care) for tests, diagnosis, and care.   What are the treatments for rheumatoid arthritis? There is no cure for RA, but early treatment can help prevent your symptoms from getting worse and damaging your joints. Treatment can include medicine, lifestyle changes, and surgery. These may slow or stop joint damage and reduce pain and swelling.  Your provider may use a combination of treatments. Your treatment may change based on your symptoms.   You can help manage your RA symptoms if you:  Are physically active Keep a healthy weight Avoid injuries to your joints Avoid activities that have repetitive motions, like bending your knee over and over Stop smoking, or don't start    NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases",

It's a group of muscles and tendons that holds the top part of your upper arm bone firmly in your shoulder socket. The rotator cuff keeps your shoulder stable when you move your arm in any direction.    What are rotator cuff injuries? Rotator cuff injuries are common. Most of them are wear-and-tear injuries from doing the same arm movements over and over - especially reaching over your head. With time, the tissues in the rotator cuff break down, leading to these injuries:  Tendinitis. The tendons in the rotator cuff connect your muscles to your shoulder bones. In tendinitis, the tendons become irritated and swollen from being pinched during shoulder movements.  Bursitis. The bursa is a small, fluid-filled sac that pads the space between the rotator cuff and the bones of your shoulder. Bursitis happens when the muscle and bone rub the bursa too much. It swells with extra fluid, which causes pain Rotator cuff tears. Tears in a rotator cuff tendon can happen over time or suddenly from an injury, such as falling on an outstretched arm or lifting something heavy. A tear may go part way through a tendon (partial tear) or all the way through (full tear).   Who is more likely to develop a rotator cuff injury? Anyone can develop a rotator cuff injury. But certain people are more likely to have one:  People over age 40. Most rotator cuff injuries are from the wear and tear of aging. By age 80, most adults have tears. Athletes. Playing sports with repeated shoulder movements increases the risk of a rotator cuff injury, for example, tennis, swimming, and baseball - especially pitching.  People in jobs that require a lot of reaching overhead or heavy lifting. Carpenters, construction workers, and painters are examples of workers who may be more likely to have rotator cuff problems.       What are the symptoms of rotator cuff injuries? Rotator cuff injuries don't always cause pain.  But when they do, the pain is often in the top part of your arm or shoulder. You may feel more pain when you:  Lie down, especially on the injured shoulder Lift your arm or lower it to the front or side Reach behind your back  Other symptoms from a torn rotator cuff may include:  Loss of strength in the arm Clicking or popping sounds when you move your arm   How are rotator cuff injuries diagnosed? To find out if you have a rotator cuff injury, your health care provider:  Will examine your shoulder. This includes checking the range of motion and where the pain is.  Will test your arm and shoulder strength.  May order imaging tests, such as  x-rays, an ultrasound, or an MRI scan.    What are the treatments for rotator cuff injuries? The best treatment for you depends on your age, how much your injury bothers you, and whether your injury was sudden or happened from wear and tear.  Treatments for rotator cuff injuries often include:  Rest  Putting ice or a cold pack on the sore area  Pain relievers to lessen pain and swelling, such as ibuprofen or aspirin  Physical therapy exercises to strengthen your shoulder and improve movement  A corticosteroid shot into your shoulder joint if other treatments don't help with the pain   Treatments for rotator cuff tendinitis and bursitis may also include ultrasound therapy. Surgery may be an option if your shoulder doesn't feel better in 6 to 12 months.  Treatments for a torn rotator cuff may also include heat to the sore area or electrical stimulation of the nerves and muscles (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, TENS). You provider may suggest surgery if your tear is large or is from a recent injury, or symptoms last for 6 to 12 months.   When should I see a health care provider for shoulder pain? If certain activities bother your shoulder, it's best to stop doing them and check with your provider. That's because early treatment can prevent mild rotator cuff injuries from becoming more serious later on. If you your arm feels weak right after a sudden injury to your shoulder, see your provider as soon as possible.",

The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid.  A health care provider may give you a prescription opioid to reduce pain after you have had a major injury or surgery. You may get them if you have severe pain from health conditions like cancer. Some providers prescribe them for chronic pain.  Prescription opioids used for pain relief are generally safe when taken for a short time and as prescribed by your provider. However, people who take opioids are at risk for opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose. These risks increase when opioids are misused. Misuse can include taking more than your prescribed dose or taking it more often, using it to get high, or taking someone else's opioids.  How do I know if I need to take opioid medicines? First, you need to talk with your provider about whether you need to take opioids. You should discuss: Whether there are other medicines or therapies that might treat your pain The risks and benefits of taking opioids Your medical history and if you or anyone in your family has a history of substance misuse, a drug addiction, or alcohol use disorder (AUD) Any other medicines and supplements you are taking How much alcohol you drink If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant   What do I need to know if I am going to take opioid medicines? If you and your provider decide that you need to take opioids, make sure that you understand: How to take the medicine - how much and how often. How long you will need to take the medicine. What the possible side effects are. How you should stop the medicines when you no longer need them. If you have been taking opioids for a while, it can be dangerous to just stop suddenly. You may need to get off the medicines slowly. What the warning signs of addiction are, so you can watch for them. They include:    Regularly taking more medicine than you are supposed to  Taking someone else's opioids  Taking the medicine to get high  Mood swings, depression, and/or anxiety  Needing too much or too little sleep  Trouble making decisions  Feeling high or sedated     If you have a high risk for an overdose, you will want to get naloxone from a pharmacy and carry it with with you wherever you go. Naloxone is a medicine that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose.  How can I take my opioid medicine safely? You should always be careful when taking any medicine, but you need to take extra care when taking opioids: Take your medicine exactly as prescribed - do not take extra doses. Check the instructions every time you take a dose. Do not break, chew, crush, or dissolve opioid pills. Opioids can cause drowsiness. Do not drive or use any machinery that may injure you, especially when you first start the medicine. Contact your provider if you have side effects. If you can, use the same pharmacy for all your medicines. The pharmacy's computer system will alert the pharmacist if you are taking two or more medicines that could cause a dangerous interaction.   How can I safely store and dispose opioid medicines? It is important to store and dispose of opioid medicines properly: Store your opioids and other medicines in a safe place. If you have children at home, it's a good idea to store your medicines in a lockbox. Even one accidental dose of an opioid pain medicine meant for an adult can cause a fatal overdose in a child. Also, someone who lives with you or visits your house may look for and steal your opioid medicines to take or sell them. If you travel, carry the current bottle of opioids with you for safety. This will help you answer any questions about your medicine. Dispose of your unused medicine properly. If you have unused opioid medicines at the end of your treatment, you can get rid of them by:    Finding a local drug take-back program  Finding a pharmacy mail-back program  In some cases, flushing them down the toilet - check the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) web site to find out which ones you can flush away   Never sell or share your medicines. Your prescription is for you. Your health care provider considers many factors when prescribing opioids. What's safe for you might lead to an overdose for someone else.

    "disease": "Sarcoidosis",
    "summary": "What is sarcoidosis?  Sarcoidosis is a condition in which groups of cells in your immune system form small, red, and swollen (inflamed) lumps. These lumps are called granulomas. They can form in any organ in the body. But they most commonly affect the lungs and lymph nodes in the chest. Over time, sarcoidosis can cause permanent scarring of organs.  What causes sarcoidosis? Your immune system creates inflammation to help defend you against germs and sickness. But in sarcoidosis, inflammation goes off track. It causes the cells in your immune system to form granulomas. Studies suggest that this inflammation might be triggered by infections and certain substances in the environment such as insecticides and mold. And your genes may affect how your immune system reacts to a trigger.  Who is more likely to develop sarcoidosis? Anyone can develop sarcoidosis, but you are more likely to have it if you:  Are older, especially if you are over age 55 Live or work near insecticides, mold, or other substances that may cause inflammation Have a close relative who has sarcoidosis Take certain medicines, such as some types of HIV medicines and monoclonal antibodies Are of African or Scandinavian descent Are female   What are the symptoms of sarcoidosis? Many people who have sarcoidosis have no symptoms, or they may feel unwell but without any obvious symptoms. If you have symptoms, you may have some general symptoms. And you may have other symptoms, which will depend upon which part of the body is affected.  The general symptoms can include:  Fatigue Weight loss Swollen lymph nodes Depression Fever Night sweats (heavy sweating during sleep)   The symptoms of sarcoidosis in the lungs can include:  Wheezing Cough Shortness of breath Chest pain   The symptoms of sarcoidosis in other parts of the body can include:  Larger than normal liver or spleen Jaundice, which can make your eyes or skin yellow Nervous system problems, such as:      Headache   Dizziness   Vision problems   Seizures   Numbness or tingling     Heart palpitations or an irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia) Pain and swelling in the joints Skin problems such as rashes and growths under the skin   There is also a set of symptoms that are called Lofgren's syndrome. Some people have Lofgren's syndrome when they first develop sarcoidosis. It usually goes away completely within 2 years. The symptoms of Lofgren's syndrome may include:  Swollen lymph nodes in your chest, neck, chin, armpits, or groin. A rash of small, itchy, or painful bumps called erythema nodosum. The rash is most often on your head, neck, or legs. Blurred vision, eye pain or redness, light sensitivity, or watery eyes. Joint pain, stiffness, or swelling. Fever.   What other problems can sarcoidosis cause? If untreated, or if the treatment does not work, sarcoidosis can cause serious health problems called complications. Possible complications include:  Lung problems Heart problems Hormone problems Brain, nerve, or muscle problems Kidney problems Severe organ damage   How is sarcoidosis diagnosed? There is no single test that can diagnose sarcoidosis, and its symptoms can be similar to the symptoms of many other conditions. That makes it hard to diagnose. To find out if you have sarcoidosis, your health care provider:  Will ask about your medical history, including your symptoms, lifestyle, and any other health conditions you may have. Will do a physical exam, which may include:      Checking your temperature   Checking to see if your lymph nodes, spleen, or liver are swollen   Listening to your chest with a stethoscope as you breathe in and out   Looking for rashes or sores on your body, such as scalp and lower legs     Will likely order various tests, such as:      Chest x-rays   A biopsy of the skin, lymph nodes, lungs, or other affected organs   Blood tests to check your blood counts, hormone levels, and how well your kidneys are working   Other imaging tests       If you are diagnosed with sarcoidosis, your provider may order other tests to look at how sarcoidosis is affecting the body.  What are the treatments for sarcoidosis? There is no cure for sarcoidosis. The goal of treatment for sarcoidosis is remission, which means you still have the condition, but it does not cause you problems.  You may not need treatment, and sometimes the condition goes away on its own. If you do need treatment, which treatment(s) you get will depend on your symptoms, which organs are affected, and whether those organs are working well. You may be given medicines to:  Lower inflammation Treat an overactive immune response Treat joint pain Treat skin problems   If you have complications from sarcoidosis, you may need other treatments, such as other medicines, surgery, oxygen therapy, pulmonary rehabilitation, or an implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator.  Whether or not you have symptoms from sarcoidosis, it's important to get regular follow-up care from your provider, make healthy lifestyle changes, and contact your provider if you have any new symptoms.

This inflammation causes you to have areas of tight, hard skin.  Scleroderma may affect just one area of your body, or it can affect many systems in your body.  What are the types of scleroderma? There are two main types of scleroderma:  Localized scleroderma only affects your skin and the muscles and tissues just under your skin. Systemic scleroderma, which is also called systemic sclerosis, is a more serious type. It affects many parts of your body and can damage your blood vessels and internal organs, such as your heart, lungs, and kidneys.   What causes scleroderma? The exact cause of scleroderma is unknown. Researchers think that several factors may play a part in causing the disease:  Your genetics. Certain genes can increase the chance that you will develop scleroderma. They may also play a role in which the type of scleroderma you have. Scleroderma is not passed from parent to child, but you are more likely to develop it if a close relative has it. Your environment. Exposure to certain things in the environment, such as viruses or chemicals, may trigger scleroderma. Immune system changes. When your immune system changes, it can trigger your cells to make too much collagen in the body. Too much collagen causes patches of tight, hard skin.  Hormones. Hormonal or immune system differences between women and men might play a part in the disease.   Who is more likely to develop scleroderma? Anyone can get scleroderma, but certain factors may make you more likely to develop it:  Your sex. Scleroderma is more common in women than in men. Your age. The disease usually appears between the ages of 30 and 50. Your race. Scleroderma can affect people of all races and ethnic groups, but the disease can affect African Americans more severely.   What are the symptoms of scleroderma? The symptoms of scleroderma are different for each person, depending on the type of scleroderma you have:  Localized scleroderma usually causes patches of thick, hard skin in one of two patterns:      Patches in firm, oval shapes that stay in one area or spread to other areas of skin. This is called morphea.   Lines of thickened or different colored skin that run down your arm, leg, and, rarely, on the forehead. This is called linear scleroderma.     Systemic scleroderma can cause problems with your internal organs as well as your skin. It can cause symptoms such as:      Thick, tight skin on your fingers   Fatigue   Raynaud's phenomenon, a narrowing of blood vessels in the hands or feet   Damage to your internal organs, including your digestive system, lungs, kidneys, and heart       How is scleroderma diagnosed? There is no single test for scleroderma. The symptoms can vary from person to person and can be similar to those of other diseases. This can make scleroderma hard to diagnose.  To find out if you have scleroderma, your health care provider:  Will ask about your symptoms and medical history Will do a physical exam May order blood tests, including an ANA (antinuclear antibody) test May do a skin biopsy May do other tests, such as imaging tests, to check for organ damage   What are the treatments for scleroderma? There is no cure for scleroderma, but treatments can help control your symptoms and limit damage. The treatments may include:  Medicines to help decrease swelling, manage pain, control other symptoms, and prevent complications. Physical or occupational therapy to help with pain, improve muscle strength, and teach you ways to help with daily living. Regular dental care, because scleroderma can make your mouth dry and damage connective tissues in your mouth. These problems can speed up tooth decay and cause your teeth to become loose.   You may need to see specialists to help treat your disease. Many people with scleroderma will see a rheumatologist. This is a doctor who specializes in rheumatic diseases such as arthritis and other inflammatory or autoimmune disorders. Dermatologists, who specialize in conditions of the skin, hair, and nails, may also play an important role in treating the disease. And if you have organ damage, you may need to see other specialists.  You can also help manage some of your symptoms, for example by:  Dressing warm and avoiding cold or wet environments Quitting smoking (if you smoke) Putting on sunscreen before you go outdoors Using moisturizers on your skin to help lessen stiffness Avoiding hot baths and showers, harsh soaps, and household cleaners Getting regular physical activity   NIH: National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases",

The effects may include:  Physical effects such as: \t \t\tBruises or genital injuries \t\tSexually transmitted infections (STIs) \t\tPregnancy \t\tOngoing problems with: \t\t\t \t\t\t\tFemale reproductive health \t\t\t\tDigestive disorders \t\t\t\tYour heart \t\t\t\tSexual health \t\t\t \t\t \t  Psychological effects such as: \t \t\tDepression or anxiety \t\tThoughts about suicide \t\tPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) \t    Sexual assault victims are more likely to smoke, have  an alcohol use disorder (AUD), use illegal drugs, and have risky sexual behavior. Girls who experience sexual violence are more likely to become victims of intimate partner violence in adulthood.  What can I do if I'm a victim of sexual assault? If you are in danger or need medical care, call 911. If you can, get away from the person who assaulted you and get to a safe place as fast as you can.   You can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800-656-HOPE (4673) to connect with a sexual assault service provider in your area who can direct you to local resources.  Getting support after a sexual assault may help you cope better and reduce the long-term effects. Victim services like rape crisis centers may offer a safe, healing place where you can find support.  Studies show that treatments such as Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) can help victims cope with depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder.  Can sexual assault be prevented? Sexual assault is never the victim's fault. No one who has been assaulted should be blamed for something that they did or did not do.   You can take some steps to try to be safer around others:  Go to parties with friends. Look out for each other. If a friend seems drunk or drugged, get them to a safe place. Have a plan for how you'll get home, too. Keep control of your drink. Someone could add alcohol or put a drug in it without you knowing. Meet people for the first time in a public place. Listen to your \"gut feelings.\" If you feel uncomfortable around someone, leave. Pay attention to your surroundings. When walking alone, stay in busy well-lit areas. And don't wear headphones; you want to be able to hear what's happening around you.   Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention",

    "disease": "Sexually Transmitted Infections",
    "summary": "What are sexually transmitted infections (STIs)?  Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are infections that are passed from one person to another through sexual contact. If not treated, a STI can develop into a sexually transmitted disease (STD).  STIs are usually spread during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. But sometimes they can spread through other sexual contact involving the penis, vagina, mouth, or anus. This is because some STIs, like herpes and HPV, are spread by skin-to-skin contact. Some STIs can be passed to the fetus during pregnancy or childbirth.  Other ways that some STIs may spread include while breastfeeding, through blood transfusions, or by sharing needles.  There are more than 20 types of STIs, including:   Chlamydia Genital herpes Genital warts Gonorrhea HIV HPV Pubic lice Syphilis Trichomoniasis   What causes sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? STIs can be caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites.   Who is affected by sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? Most STIs affect both men and women, but in many cases the health problems they cause can be more severe for women.  If an STI is passed to a fetus during pregnancy or childbirth, it can cause serious health problems.  What are the symptoms of sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? STIs don't always cause symptoms or may only cause mild symptoms. So, it is possible to have an infection and not know it. And even without symptoms, STIs can still be harmful and may be passed on during sex. If you do have symptoms, they could include:   Unusual discharge from the penis or vagina Sores or warts on the genital area Painful or frequent urination (peeing) Itching and redness in the genital area Blisters or sores in or around the mouth Abnormal vaginal odor Anal itching, soreness, or bleeding Abdominal (belly) pain Fever   How are sexually transmitted infections (STIs) diagnosed? If you are sexually active, you should talk to your health care provider about your risk for STIs and whether you need to be tested. This is especially important since many STIs do not usually cause symptoms.  Some STIs may be diagnosed during a physical exam or through STI testing. Some tests involve a microscopic examination of a sore or fluid swabbed from the vagina, penis, or anus. Blood tests can diagnose other types of STIs.   What are the treatments for sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? Antibiotics can treat STIs that are caused by bacteria or parasites. There is no cure for STIs caused by viruses, but antiviral medicines can often help with the symptoms and lower your risk of spreading the infection. It's important to get treatment if you have an STI. Some types of STIs can cause serious health problems if they are not treated. Talk to your provider about how long to not have sex after treatment to avoid passing the infection back and forth with your partner.  Can sexually transmitted infections (STIs) be prevented? The surest way to protect yourself against STIs is to not have sex.  If you do decide to have sex, you can lower your risk of getting an STI by:  Having you and your partner tested for STIs before having sex. Using a condom every time you have sex. Correct usage of latex condoms greatly reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of catching or spreading STIs. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. Reducing your number of sex partners. You might even consider \"mutual monogamy\" with just one partner. This means that you agree to be sexually active only with them, and they agree to be sexually active only with you. But first you should both get tested to make sure that you don't already have an STI. Getting vaccinated against HPV and hepatitis B.",

    "disease": "Shingles",
    "summary": "What is shingles? Shingles (herpes zoster) is an infection that causes a painful rash. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). This is the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have chickenpox, the virus stays in your body. It may not cause problems for many years. But as you get older, the virus may become active again and cause shingles.   Is shingles contagious? Shingles is not contagious. You cannot get shingles from someone else. But you can catch chickenpox from someone with shingles if you have direct contact with fluid from their shingles rash.   The risk of spreading the virus is low if the shingles rash is kept covered. People with shingles cannot spread the virus before their rash blisters appear or after the rash crusts.   Who is at risk for shingles? Anyone who has had chickenpox can get shingles. But the risk of shingles goes up as you get older. Shingles is most common in people over age 50.  People with weakened immune systems are at higher risk of getting shingles. This includes those who: Have immune system diseases such as HIV Have certain cancers Take medicines that weaken their immune system, such as steroids and medicines you take after  organ transplant   Your immune system may be weaker when you have an infection or are stressed. This can raise your risk of shingles.  It is rare, but possible, to get shingles more than once.  What are the symptoms of shingles? Early signs of shingles include burning or shooting pain and tingling or itching. It is usually on one side of the body or face. The pain can be mild to severe.  Up to several days later, you will get a rash. It consists of blisters that typically scab over in 7 to 10 days. The rash is usually a single stripe around either the left or the right side of the body. In other cases, the rash is only on one side of the face. In rare cases (usually among people with weakened immune systems), the rash may be more widespread. It might look similar to a chickenpox rash.   Some people may also have other symptoms: Fever Headache Chills Upset stomach   What other problems can shingles cause? Shingles can cause other problems (complications): Postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) is most common complication of shingles. It causes severe pain in the areas where you had the shingles rash. It usually gets better in a few weeks or months. But some people can have pain from PHN for many years, and it can interfere with daily life. Vision loss can happen if shingles affects your eye. It may be temporary or permanent. Hearing or balance problems are possible if you have shingles within or near your ear. You may also have weakness of the muscles on that side of your face. These problems can be temporary or permanent.   Very rarely, shingles can also lead to pneumonia, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death.  How is shingles diagnosed? Usually your health care provider can diagnose shingles by taking your medical history and looking at your rash. In some cases, your provider may scrap off tissue from the rash or swab some fluid from the blisters and send the sample to a lab for testing.  What are the treatments for shingles? There is no cure for shingles. Antiviral medicines may help to make the attack shorter and less severe. They may also help prevent PHN. The medicines are most effective if you can take them within 3 days after the rash appears. So if you think you might have shingles, contact your provider as soon as possible.  Pain relievers may also help with the pain. A cool washcloth, calamine lotion, and oatmeal baths may help relieve some of the itching.  Can shingles be prevented? There is a vaccine, called Shingrix, to help prevent shingles and its complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that healthy adults 50 years and older get the vaccine. Your provider might also recommend the vaccine if you are over 19 and have a weakened immune system. The vaccine is given in two doses.  If you have shingles, you can help prevent spreading the virus to others by:  Staying away from:      People with weakened immune systems   People who have not had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine, especially if they are pregnant   Premature or low birth weight babies     Keeping the rash covered Not touching or scratching the rash Washing your hands often   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

Your shoulders are the most movable joints in your body. They can also be unstable because the ball of the upper arm is larger than the shoulder socket that holds it. To remain in a stable or normal position, the shoulder must be anchored by muscles, tendons, and ligaments.  Because your shoulder can be unstable, it can be easily injured. Common problems include: Sprains and strains Dislocations Separations Tendinitis Bursitis  Torn rotator cuffs Frozen shoulder Fractures (broken bones) Arthritis   Health care providers diagnose shoulder problems by using your medical history, a physical exam, and imaging tests.  Often, the first treatment for shoulder problems is RICE. This stands for Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation. Other treatments include exercise and medicines to reduce pain and swelling.

    "disease": "Sickle Cell Disease",
    "summary": "What is sickle cell disease (SCD)? Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a group of inherited red blood cell disorders. If you have SCD, there is a problem with your hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout the body. With SCD, the hemoglobin forms into stiff rods within the red blood cells. This changes the shape of the red blood cells. The cells are supposed to be disc-shaped, but instead they are crescent, or sickle, shaped.   The sickle-shaped cells are not flexible and cannot change shape easily. Many of them burst apart as they move through your blood vessels. The sickle cells usually only last 10 to 20 days, instead of the normal 90 to 120 days. Your body may have trouble making enough new cells to replace the ones that you lost. Because of this, you may not have enough red blood cells. This is a condition called anemia, and it can make you feel tired.  The sickle-shaped cells can also stick to vessel walls, causing a blockage that slows or stops the flow of blood. When this happens, oxygen can't reach nearby tissues. The lack of oxygen can cause attacks of sudden, severe pain, called pain crises. These attacks can occur without warning. If you get one, you might need to go to the hospital for treatment.  What causes sickle cell disease (SCD)? SCD is caused by a variant (change) in a gene that has instructions for your body to make one part of the hemoglobin. This changed gene is sometimes called a sickle cell gene. People with SCD are born with two sickle cell genes, one from each parent.    If you are born with one sickle cell gene, it's called sickle cell trait. People with sickle cell trait are generally healthy, but they can pass the defective gene on to their children.   Who is more likely to have sickle cell disease (SCD)? In the United States, most of the people with SCD are African Americans: About 1 in 13 Black or African American babies are born with sickle cell trait About 1 in every 365 Black or African American babies are born with sickle cell disease   SCD also affects some people who come from Hispanic, southern European, Middle Eastern, or Asian Indian backgrounds.  What are the symptoms of sickle cell disease (SCD)? People with SCD start to have signs of the disease during the first year of life, usually around 5 or 6 months of age. Early symptoms of SCD may include: Painful swelling of the hands and feet Fatigue or fussiness from anemia A yellowish color of the skin (jaundice) or the whites of the eyes (icterus)   The effects of SCD vary from person to person and can change over time. Most of the signs and symptoms of SCD are related to complications of the disease. They may include severe pain, anemia, organ damage, and infections.  How is sickle cell disease (SCD) diagnosed? A blood test can show if you have SCD or sickle cell trait. Genetic tests can tell if you have one or two copies of the sickle cell gene. Genetic tests can help confirm an SCD diagnosis if the results from blood tests are not clear.   All states now test newborns for SCD (as well as many other treatable conditions) as part of their screening programs. These programs help find the conditions early, so treatment can be started right away.  Health care providers can also diagnose SCD before a baby is born. That test uses a sample of amniotic fluid (the liquid in the sac surrounding the baby) or tissue taken from the placenta (the organ that brings oxygen and nutrients to the baby).  People who are thinking about having children can have the test to find out how likely it is that their children will have SCD.  What are the treatments for sickle cell disease (SCD)? There are many ways to manage sickle cell disease. Your medical team will probably include a hematologist, a doctor who specializes in blood diseases. You will work with your medical team to set up a treatment plan. Possible treatment options may include:  Treatments that can help relieve symptoms and lessen complications, including:      Hydroxyurea, a medicine to reduce sickling of red blood cells. This can help prevent serious symptoms of sickle cell disease. This medicine can be used in adults and in children as young as 9 months old.  But this medicine is not safe during pregnancy.    Voxelotor, another medicine to prevent the sickling of red blood cells. It can be used in adults and children ages 4 years and older.   Pain relievers for acute or chronic pain.   Antibiotics to try to prevent infections in younger children.   Blood transfusions for severe anemia. If you have had some serious complications, such as a stroke, you may have transfusions to prevent more complications.   Other treatments for specific complications, such as medicines to lower blood pressure  and vitamins to treat a vitamin deficiency.     Bone marrow or stem cell transplantation, which can cure SCD. Because these transplants are risky and can have serious side effects, they are usually only used in children with severe SCD. For the transplant to work, the bone marrow must be a close match. Usually, the best donor is a brother or sister.  Gene therapies to treat SCD in people who are 12 years and older and have had repeated sickle cell crises. These new therapies involve taking some of your blood stem cells and either adding new DNA to them or changing their existing DNA. Then these cells are given back to you, and they can make a type of hemoglobin that is healthy. This can reduce the complications of SCD, including the SCD crises.    Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) seems to help some people deal with pain caused by SCD. These types of CAM may lower your pain, especially if it is not well managed with medicines::  Cognitive behavioral therapy (a type of counseling) Acupuncture Exercise or movement programs, such as yoga Massage Meditation and mindfulness practices Virtual reality, a computer-generated 3D environment you can see with special goggles   It's also important to take steps to keep yourself as healthy as possible:  Get regular medical care Get your routine vaccinations Live a healthy lifestyle Avoid situations that may set off a pain crisis   NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "summary": "What is Sjogren's syndrome?  Sjogren's syndrome, also called Sjogren's disease, is a chronic (long-lasting) autoimmune disease. When you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs by mistake. In Sjogren's syndrome, your immune system attacks the glands that make moisture in the eyes, mouth, and other parts of the body. This causes a dry mouth and dry eyes. You may have dryness in other places that need moisture, such as your nose, throat, and skin. Sjogren's can also affect other parts of the body, including your joints, lungs, kidneys, blood vessels, digestive organs, and nerves.  What causes Sjogren's syndrome? Normally, your immune system protects the body from infection and disease. But with Sjogren's syndrome and other autoimmune diseases, your immune system attacks healthy tissues and organs. Researchers don't know for sure what causes the immune system to do this. But they think that it is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Studies have linked Sjogren's syndrome to gene changes in several genes. Some researchers also think that the disease may be triggered by something in the environment. For example, they think that one possible trigger could be a previous infection with a virus or bacteria.  Who is more likely to develop Sjogren's syndrome? Most people with Sjogren's syndrome are women. You can get it at any age, but it is most common in people in their 40s and 50s.  Sjogren's syndrome is more common in people who have other autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. This is known as a secondary form of Sjogren's syndrome. People who don't have another autoimmune disease have a primary form of Sjogren's syndrome.  What are the symptoms of Sjogren's syndrome? Sjogren's syndrome may have different effects on the body. Not everyone will have the same symptoms. Some people have cycles of mild and then severe symptoms.   The two main symptoms are:  Dry eyes. Your eyes may burn or itch or feel like they have sand in them. Sometimes your vision may be blurry, or you could be bothered by bright lights. Dry mouth. Your tongue and your throat may feel dry. You might have trouble swallowing, speaking, and tasting.   Sjogren's syndrome can also affect other parts of the body, causing symptoms such as:  Joint and muscle pain Dry skin Rashes on the skin of hands or feet Numbness or tingling in the hands or feet Vaginal dryness Dry cough that doesn't go away Fatigue that doesn't go away   How is Sjogren's syndrome diagnosed? There is no single test for Sjogren's syndrome. To find out if you have it, your provider:  Will ask about your medical history and symptoms. Will do a physical exam, which includes checking for signs of dry mouth and signs of related autoimmune diseases. May order tests, including:      Eye tests to see if you produce a normal amount of tears and to find out if your eyes have been damaged by dryness.   Salivary gland tests to measure how much saliva your mouth produces. They could include imaging tests and a biopsy.   Blood tests.       What are the treatments for Sjogren's syndrome? There is no cure for Sjogren's syndrome. Treatment focuses on relieving your symptoms. The treatments can be different for each person, depending on which parts of the body are affected. They may include:  Eye drops (artificial tears) or ointments to relieve dryness in the eyes. Saliva substitutes. Prescription medicines that cause your salivary glands to make more saliva. A minor procedure that places small plugs the tear duct in the corners of the eyes. The plugs block your tears from draining so they stay in your eyes longer. Medicines to help with other symptoms caused by Sjogren's syndrome, such as medicines for pain and inflammation. Medicines that suppress (weaken) your immune system (for severe cases).   You can also try to relieve some of your symptoms by sucking on sugar-free candy, drinking water often, increasing the humidity in your room, and not smoking. Because having a dry mouth can raise your risk of cavities, it's important to take good care of your teeth and see your dentist regularly.",

    "summary": "What are skin infections? Your skin is your body's largest organ. It has many different functions, including covering and protecting your body. It helps keep germs out. But sometimes the germs can cause a skin infection. It often happens when the germs enter your body through a break, cut, or wound on your skin. Other skin infections can happen in places where the skin rubs together, especially if the area is moist. Infections can also happen when you have a poor blood supply to an area of your body or if your immune system is weakened because of another disease or a medical treatment.  Some skin infections cover a small area on the top of your skin. Other infections can go deep into your skin or spread to a larger area.  What causes skin infections? Skin infections are caused by different kinds of germs. For example,: Bacteria cause cellulitis, impetigo, and staphylococcal (staph) infections Viruses cause shingles, warts, and herpes simplex Fungi cause athlete's foot and yeast infections Parasites cause body lice, head lice, and scabies   Who is more likely to get a skin infection? You are more likely to get a skin infection if you:  Have poor circulation Have diabetes Are older Have an immune system disease, such as HIV Have a weakened immune system because of chemotherapy or other medicines that suppress your immune system Have to stay in one position for a long time, such as if you are sick and have to stay in bed for a long time or you are paralyzed Are malnourished Have excessive skinfolds, which can happen if you have obesity   What are the symptoms of skin infections?\t The symptoms depend on the type of infection. Some symptoms that are common to many skin infections include rashes, swelling, redness, pain, pus, and itching.  How are skin infections diagnosed? To diagnose a skin infection, your health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. You may have lab tests, such as a skin culture. This is a test to identify what type of infection you have, using a sample from your skin. Your provider may take the sample by swabbing or scraping your skin or removing a small piece of skin (biopsy). Sometimes providers use other tests, such as blood tests.  How are skin infections treated? The treatment depends on the type of infection and how serious it is. Some infections will go away on their own. When you do need treatment, it may include a cream or lotion to put on the skin. Other possible treatments include medicines and a procedure to drain pus.",

When these cells become damaged or unhealthy, it affects melanin production. Some pigmentation disorders affect just patches of skin. Others affect your entire body.   If your body makes too much melanin, your skin gets darker. Pregnancy, Addison's disease, and sun exposure all can make your skin darker. If your body makes too little melanin, your skin gets lighter. Vitiligo is a condition that causes patches of light skin. Albinism is a genetic condition affecting a person's skin.

They may occur 30 times or more an hour.  The most common type is obstructive sleep apnea. It causes your airway to collapse or become blocked during sleep. Normal breathing starts again with a snort or choking sound. People with sleep apnea often snore loudly. However, not everyone who snores has sleep apnea.  You are more at risk for sleep apnea if you are overweight, male, or have a family history or small airways.  Children with enlarged tonsils or adenoids may also get it.  Doctors diagnose sleep apnea based on medical and family histories, a physical exam, and sleep study results.  When your sleep is interrupted throughout the night, you can be drowsy during the day. People with sleep apnea are at higher risk for car crashes, work-related accidents, and other medical problems. If you have it, it is important to get treatment. Lifestyle changes, mouthpieces, surgery, and breathing devices can treat sleep apnea in many people.  NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

    "summary": "What is sleep?  While you are sleeping  your brain and body functions are still active. Sleep is a natural process that helps your body restore energy, supports learning and memory, and keeps you healthy.   It's not just the number of hours of sleep you get that matters. The quality of your sleep is also important. During the night, your brain cycles through different stages of non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. If your sleep is often interrupted, you may not get enough time in certain stages of sleep. Poor-quality sleep does more than make you feel tired. It can affect your physical and mental health, thinking, and daily functioning.   What are sleep disorders? Sleep disorders are conditions that disturb your normal sleep patterns. There are many types of sleep disorders. Some general types include:   Insomnia, which is trouble falling asleep or staying asleep.  Sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnea, a condition in which you stop breathing for 10 seconds or more during sleep. Sleep-related movement disorders such as restless leg syndrome (RLS), which involves tingling or prickling sensations in your legs, and a strong urge to move them. Hypersomnia, which is extreme daytime sleepiness. This includes narcolepsy. Circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, which are problems falling asleep or waking up at the right times. This may be due to shift work or jet lag. Parasomnia, which is unusual behaviors during sleep or while falling asleep or waking up. This may include sleepwalking, talking, or eating during sleep.   Some people who feel tired during the day have a true sleep disorder, while others simply don't get enough sleep. The amount of sleep you need depends on your age, lifestyle, health, and sleep patterns. Most adults need about 7-9 hours each night.  What causes sleep disorders? There are different causes for different sleep disorders. They may include:  Other health conditions, such as heart disease, lung disease, nerve disorders, or pain Mental illnesses, including depression and anxiety Medicines Genetics   Sometimes the cause is unknown.  Other factors that may contribute to sleep problems include:  Using caffeine or alcohol  Having an irregular schedule, such as working the night shift Aging, since older adults may sleep less, spend less time in deep sleep, and wake easily   What are the symptoms of sleep disorders? The symptoms of sleep disorders depend on the specific disorder. Some signs that you may have a sleep disorder include that:  You regularly take more than 30 minutes to fall asleep. You regularly wake up several times and then have trouble falling back to sleep, or you wake up too early in the morning. You often feel sleepy during the day, take frequent naps, or fall asleep at the wrong times during the day. Your bed partner says that when you sleep, you snore loudly, snort, gasp, make choking sounds, or stop breathing for short periods. You have creeping or tingling sensations in your legs or arms that are relieved by moving or massaging them, especially in the evening and when trying to fall asleep. Your bed partner notices that your legs or arms jerk often during sleep. You have vivid, dreamlike experiences while falling asleep or dozing. You have episodes of sudden muscle weakness triggered by strong emotions.  You feel as though you cannot move or speak for a brief time when you first wake up.   How are sleep disorders diagnosed? To diagnose a sleep disorder, your health care provider will review your medical and sleep history and do a physical exam. You may also have a sleep study (polysomnogram). Most sleep studies  monitor and record data about your body during a full night of sleep. The data includes:  Brain wave activity Eye movements Breathing rate Blood pressure Heart rate and electrical activity in the heart and other muscles   Other types of sleep studies may check how quickly you fall asleep during daytime naps or how well you can stay awake during the day.\t  What are the treatments for sleep disorders? Treatments for sleep disorders depend on which disorder you have. They may include:  Practicing good sleep habits and other lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and getting regular exercise Reducing anxiety about sleep with cognitive behavioral therapy or relaxation techniques Using a CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) machine for sleep apnea Using bright light therapy (in the morning) Taking sleep aid medicines, or natural products such as melatonin   Always check with your provider before taking any medicine or supplement.

    "summary": "What are the health effects of smoking? There's no way around it; smoking is bad for your health. It harms nearly every organ of the body, even some that you would not expect. Cigarette smoking causes many cancers and other health problems. It is also the cause of nearly one in five deaths in the United States.  Some of the many health problems that smoking can cause include:  Cancers. Smoking is the most common cause of lung and oral cancers. But it can also cause cancer in many other parts of your body, such as in your larynx (voice box), esophagus, throat, bladder, kidney, liver, stomach, pancreas, colon and rectum, and cervix. It can also cause acute myeloid leukemia (AML).  Lung diseases. Smoking is the most common cause of COPD. It can also worsen asthma and raise your risk of pneumonia. Cardiovascular diseases.  Smoking can damage your blood vessels and make them thicken and grow narrower. This makes your heart  beat faster and raises your blood pressure. Smoking also increases your risk of blood clots and stroke. Vision problems. Smoking can raise your risk of  cataracts and cause macular degeneration (AMD).   You have a greater chance of certain pregnancy problems if you smoke while pregnant.   Your baby is also at higher risk of dying of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).  Smoking also causes addiction to nicotine, a stimulant drug that is in tobacco. Nicotine addiction makes it much harder for people to quit smoking.  What are the health risks of secondhand smoke? Your smoke is also bad for other people. If they breathe in your secondhand smoke, they can get many of the same problems as smokers do. These problems can include heart disease and lung cancer. Children exposed to secondhand smoke have a higher risk of ear infections, colds, pneumonia, bronchitis, and more severe asthma. If you breathe secondhand smoke while pregnant, you're more likely to have preterm labor and a baby with low birth weight.   Are other forms of tobacco also dangerous? Besides cigarettes, there are several other forms of tobacco. Some people smoke tobacco in cigars and water pipes (hookahs). These forms of tobacco also contain harmful chemicals and nicotine. Some cigars contain as much tobacco as an entire pack of cigarettes.   E-cigarettes often look like cigarettes, but they work differently. They are battery-operated smoking devices. Using an e-cigarette is called vaping. Researchers still have a lot to learn about the health effects of using e-cigarettes. We do know that they contain nicotine, which is highly addictive and a health danger to you and your fetus if you are pregnant, children, and teens. And e-cigarettes also expose non-smokers to secondhand aerosols (rather than secondhand smoke), which contain harmful chemicals.  Smokeless tobacco, such as chewing tobacco and snuff, is also bad for your health. Smokeless tobacco can cause certain cancers, including oral cancer. It also increases your risk of getting heart disease, gum disease, and oral lesions.   Why should I quit? Remember, there is no safe level of tobacco use. Smoking even just one cigarette per day over a lifetime can cause smoking-related cancers and premature death. Quitting smoking can reduce your risk of health problems and add years to your life. The earlier you quit, the greater the benefit. Some immediate benefits of quitting include: Lower heart rate and blood pressure Less carbon monoxide in the blood (carbon monoxide reduces the blood's ability to carry oxygen) Better circulation Less coughing and wheezing   Quitting smoking can be challenging, but it is so important for your health. Contact your health care provider if you need help quitting.",

    "disease": "Spinal Muscular Atrophy",
    "summary": "What is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)?  Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a group of genetic diseases that damages and kills motor neurons. Motor neurons are a type of nerve cell in the spinal cord and lower part of the brain. They control movement in your arms, legs, face, chest, throat, and tongue.  As the motor neurons die off, your muscles start to weaken and atrophy (waste away). The muscle damage gets worse over time and can affect speaking, walking, swallowing, and breathing.  What are the types of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and what are their symptoms? There are different types of SMA. They are based on how serious the disease is and when the symptoms start: Type l is also called Werdnig-Hoffman disease or infantile-onset SMA. It is the most severe type. It is also the most common. Babies with this type usually show signs of the disease before 6 months of age. In more severe cases, the signs show up even before or just after birth (Types 0 or 1A). The babies may have trouble swallowing and breathing and may not move around a lot. They have chronic shortening of muscles or tendons (called contractures). They usually cannot sit up without help. Without treatment, many children with this type will die before 2 years of age. Type ll is a moderate to severe type of SMA. It usually first noticed between 6 and 18 months of age. Most children with this type can sit without support but cannot stand or walk without help. They may also have trouble breathing. They can usually live into adolescence or young adulthood. Type lll is also called Kugelberg-Welander disease. It is the mildest type that affects children. The signs of the disease usually show up after age 18 months. Children with this type can walk by themselves but may have trouble running, getting up from a chair, or climbing stairs. They may also have scoliosis (curvature of the spine), contractures, and respiratory infections. With treatment, most children with this type will have a normal lifespan. Type IV is rare and often mild. It usually causes symptoms after 21 years of age. The symptoms include mild to moderate leg muscle weakness, tremors, and mild breathing problems. The symptoms slowly get worse over time. People with this type of SMA have a normal lifespan.   What causes spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)? Most types of SMA are caused by a change in the SMN1 gene. This gene is responsible for making a protein that the motor neurons need to be healthy and to function. But when part of the SMN1 gene is missing or abnormal, there isn't enough protein for the motor neurons. This causes the motor neurons to die off. Most people have two copies of the SM1 gene - one from each parent. SMA normally only happens when both copies have the gene change. If only one copy has the change, there usually aren't any symptoms. But that gene could be passed down from parent to child. Some of the less common types of SMA may be caused by changes in other genes.  How is spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose SMA: A physical exam A medical history, including asking about family history Genetic testing to check for the gene changes that cause SMA Electromyography and nerve conduction studies and a muscle biopsy may be done, especially if no gene changes were found   Parents who have a family history of SMA may want to do a prenatal test to check to see whether their baby has an SMN1 gene change. An amniocentesis or in some cases a chorionic villi sampling (CVS) is used to get the sample for testing. In some states, genetic testing for SMA is part of newborn screening tests.  What are the treatments for spinal muscular atrophy (SMA)? There is no cure for SMA. Treatments can help manage symptoms and prevent complications. They may include: Medicines to help the body make more of the proteins that the motor neurons need Gene therapy for children under 2 years of age Physical, occupational, and rehabilitation therapy to help to improve posture and the mobility of the joints. These therapies may also improve blood flow and slow muscle weakness and atrophy. Some people may also need therapy for trouble speaking, chewing, and swallowing. Assistive devices such as supports or braces, orthotics, speech synthesizers, and wheelchairs to help people stay more independent Good nutrition and a balanced diet to help maintain weight and strength. Some people might need a feeding tube in order to get the nutrition they need. Breathing support for people who have muscle weakness in the neck, throat, and chest. The support may include devices to help with breathing during the day and to prevent sleep apnea at night. Some people might need to be on a ventilator.

    "disease": "Staphylococcal Infections",
    "summary": "What are Staphylococcal (staph) infections?  Staphylococcus (staph) is a group of bacteria. There are more than 30 types. A type called Staphylococcus aureus causes most infections.  Staph bacteria can cause many different types of infections, including: Skin infections, which are the most common types of staph infections. Bacteremia, an infection of the bloodstream. This can lead to sepsis, a very serious immune response to infection. Bone infections. Endocarditis, an infection of the inner lining of the heart chambers and valves. Food poisoning. Pneumonia. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a life-threatening condition caused by toxins from certain types of bacteria.   What causes staph infections?  Some people carry staph bacteria on their skin or in their noses, but they do not get an infection. But if they get a cut or wound, the bacteria can enter the body and cause an infection.  Staph bacteria can spread from person to person. They can also spread on objects, such as towels, clothing, door handles, athletic equipment, and remotes. If you have staph and do not handle food properly when you are preparing it, you can also spread staph to others.  Who is more likely to get a staph infection?  Anyone can develop a staph infection, but certain people are more likely to get one, including those who: Have a chronic condition such as diabetes, cancer, vascular disease, eczema, and lung disease Have a weakened immune system, such as from HIV, medicines to prevent organ rejection, or chemotherapy Had surgery Are in the hospital Use a catheter, breathing tube, or feeding tube Have an implanted device, such as a pacemaker or artificial joint or heart valve Have burns, especially if they are deep or cover a large area of the body Are on dialysis Inject illegal drugs Do contact sports, since you may have skin-to-skin contact with others or share equipment   What are the symptoms of staph infections?  The symptoms of a staph infection depend on the type of infection: Skin infections can look like pimples or boils. They may be red, swollen, and painful. Sometimes there is pus or other drainage. They can turn into impetigo, which turns into a crust on the skin, or cellulitis, a swollen, red area of skin that feels hot. Bone infections can cause pain, swelling, warmth, and redness in the infected area. You may also have chills and a fever. Endocarditis causes some flu-like symptoms: fever, chills, and fatigue. It also causes symptoms such as rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, and fluid buildup in your arms or legs. Food poisoning typically causes nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. If you lose too many fluids, you may also become dehydrated.  Pneumonia symptoms include a high fever, chills, and cough that doesn't get better. You may also have chest pain and shortness of breath. Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) causes high fever, sudden low blood pressure, vomiting, diarrhea, and confusion. You may have a sunburn-like rash somewhere on your body. TSS can lead to organ failure.   How are staph infections diagnosed?  Your health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. Often, providers can tell if you have a staph skin infection by looking at it. To check for other types of staph infections, providers may do a culture, with a skin scraping, tissue sample, stool sample, or throat or nasal swabs. There may be other tests, such as imaging tests, depending on the type of infection.  What are the treatments for staph infections?  Treatment for staph infections is antibiotics. Depending on the type of infection, the antibiotics might be a cream, ointment, medicines (to swallow), or intravenous (IV) medicine. If you have an infected wound, your provider might drain it. Sometimes you may need surgery for bone infections.  Some staph infections, such as MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), are resistant to many antibiotics. There are still certain antibiotics that can treat these infections.  Can staph infections be prevented?  Certain steps can help to prevent staph infections: Use good hygiene, including washing your hands often. Don't share towels, sheets, or clothing with someone who has a staph infection. It's best not to share athletic equipment. If you do need to share, make sure that it is properly cleaned and dried before you use it. Practice food safety, including not preparing food for others when you have a staph infection. If you have a cut or wound, keep it covered.",

    "disease": "Statins",
    "summary": "What is cholesterol? Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that's found in all the cells in your body. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly.  But if you have too much of it in your blood, it can stick to the walls of your arteries and narrow or even block them. This puts you at risk for coronary artery disease and other heart diseases.  Cholesterol is made by your liver. It travels through the blood on proteins called lipoproteins. One type of lipoprotein, LDL, is sometimes called the \"bad\" cholesterol. A high LDL level leads to a buildup of cholesterol in your arteries. Another type, HDL, is sometimes called the \"good\" cholesterol. It carries cholesterol from other parts of your body back to your liver. Then your liver removes the cholesterol from your body.  What are statins? Statins are a type of cholesterol medicine. Your health care provider may prescribe them if you have high cholesterol and making lifestyle changes does not lower your cholesterol enough. Statins are the most common medicines used to treat high cholesterol.      How do statins lower cholesterol? Statins lower LDL cholesterol by slowing down how much cholesterol the liver makes. They also increase your liver's ability to remove LDL cholesterol that is already in the blood. This can slow the formation of plaques in your arteries. Studies have shown that statins lower the risk of heart attack and stroke in people with high LDL cholesterol.  Statins can lower your triglyceride level as well. Triglycerides are another type of fat in your blood that can raise the risk of heart disease. Statins may also increase your HDL cholesterol.  What are the risks of taking statins? Statins usually don't cause side effects, but they may raise the risk of type 2 diabetes. However, this mainly happens in people already at high risk of diabetes, such as those who are overweight or have obesity, prediabetes, or metabolic syndrome.  Statins may also cause abnormal results on liver enzymes tests, but actual liver damage is very rare. Another uncommon side effect is muscle damage. In rare cases, this muscle damage can lead to muscle pain and kidney damage.  You should not take statins if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. They are also not recommended for people who have certain types of liver disease.  How can I safely take statins? To safely take statins, you should:  Take your statin as prescribed. You should not stop taking this medicine on your own, since that can lead to a serious problem or, in rare cases, even cause death. Talk to your provider if you have any concerns about your statin or if you would like to stop or change to a different treatment. Ask your provider which other medicines, supplements, or foods you should avoid. Some of these can interact with statins and cause serious side effects or make statins less effective. For example, grapefruit (fresh or as juice) affects how your liver breaks down some statins. Tell your provider about any symptoms or side effects you are having. Sometimes, people report muscle problems while taking statins. If you start having muscle pain, your provider may order a blood test to look look for muscle damage. The pain may go away if you switch to a different statin. Muscle damage with statins is rare, and your muscles may heal when you switch to a different medicine.",

    "summary": "What is a stillbirth? If you lose a fetus at or after the 20th week of pregnancy, it's called a stillbirth. A stillbirth can occur before or during delivery and may be considered as:   Early. The loss of a fetus between 20 and 27 weeks of pregnancy. Late. The loss of a fetus between 28 and 36 weeks of pregnancy. Term. The loss of a fetus at 37 or more weeks of pregnancy.   What are the risk factors for stillbirth? Stillbirth can happen in any pregnancy. Some factors may increase the chance that one can occur. Risk factors can include if you:  Are age 35 years or older Are of low socioeconomic status Smoke during pregnancy Have certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or high blood pressure Are a non-Hispanic Black woman  Previously had a stillbirth Are pregnant with more than one baby (twins or triplets)    What are the possible causes of stillbirth? In many cases, the cause remains unknown. Some causes may be preventable, but most are not.   Causes for a stillbirth may include:  Problems with the placenta, the organ that carries oxygen and nutrients to the fetus Genetic problems with the fetus  Fetal infections  Other physical problems in the fetus Problems with the umbilical cord during labor and delivery   How is a stillbirth diagnosed? Before delivery, the only way to diagnose a stillbirth is to check if the fetus's heart is beating. Your health care provider may use an ultrasound  to look for the fetal heartbeat.   During your pregnancy, your provider may recommend keeping track of fetal movements. However, if you don't notice movement, it doesn't always mean a stillbirth occurred. Sometimes, especially if it's your first pregnancy, it might be difficult to notice movement. If you're pregnant and something seems unusual or is worrying you, talk to your provider.  After labor and delivery, your provider will check the baby for signs of life. These can include breathing, heartbeat, voluntary movements, and pulsations in the umbilical cord. If one or more signs of life are not present, then life-saving measures are taken. If these measures are unsuccessful, a stillbirth may be diagnosed.   How do health care providers manage a stillbirth? Care after a stillbirth depends on when it occurs. If it happens before delivery, your provider may induce (start) labor or use surgery to deliver the fetus (cesarean delivery). If it happens during labor and delivery, the placenta will still need to be removed or delivered.  No matter when it occurs, losing a pregnancy can be difficult. Counseling may help you cope with your grief. Later, if you decide to try to get pregnant again, work closely with your provider to understand any risks. Many women who have a stillbirth go on to have healthy babies.   NIH: National Institute of Child Health and Human Development",

    "disease": "Stress",
    "summary": "What is stress? Stress is how your brain and body respond to a challenge or demand. When you are stressed, your body releases certain hormones. Hormones are chemicals that travel in your bloodstream and control how different parts of your body work. The hormones that are released when you are stressed make you alert and ready to act. They can raise your blood pressure, heart rate, and blood glucose (blood sugar) levels. This response is sometimes called a \"fight or flight\" response.  Everyone gets stressed from time to time. There are different types of stress. It can be short-term or long-term. It can be caused by something that happens once or something that keeps happening.   Not all stress is bad. In fact, it can help you survive in a dangerous situation. For example, one kind of stress is the jolt you may feel when a car pulls out in front of you while you are driving. This jolt of hormones helps you quickly hit the brakes to avoid an accident. A little short-term stress can sometimes be helpful. For example, the stress of having a deadline for school or your job may push you to get your work done on time. Once you finish it, that stress goes away.   But stress that lasts a long time can harm your health.   What causes long-term stress? Long-term stress, or chronic stress, lasts for weeks, months, or longer. As you go about your life, your body is acting as if you're being threatened.   Causes of long-term stress include:  Routine stress from the demands of work, school, family needs, money problems, and other daily pressures that don't stop. Stress from sudden, difficult changes in your life, such as divorce, illness, losing your job, or other unhappy life events that often have a long impact. Traumatic stress, which may happen when you're in danger of serious harm or death. Examples include being in a bad accident, a war, a flood, earthquake, or other frightening event. This type of stress can cause a long-lasting problem called post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).   How can long term-stress harm my health? People respond to stress in different ways. If you're stressed for a long time you may notice that you are:   Getting sick more often than usual because stress weakens your body's ability to fight germs Having stomach problems or trouble digesting food Having trouble sleeping Having headaches Feeling sad, angry, or easily upset   When stress keeps going, your body acts as if you're always in danger. That's a lot of strain that may play a part in developing serious health problems, including:     Depression Anxiety Heart disease High blood pressure Diabetes   It's possible to get used to the symptoms of stress and not even realize there's a problem. So when there's a lot of stress in your life, it's important to pay attention to how it affects you so you can do something about it.  How can I manage long-term stress? Simple things that improve your mental health may be helpful in managing long-term stress, such as:    Get regular exercise. A 30-minute daily walk can help you feel better and help keep your immune system strong, so you don't get sick. Try relaxing activities. You could look for an app or wellness program that uses breathing, meditation, or muscle relaxation exercises.  Get enough sleep every night. Avoid too much caffeine. Decide what you need to do now and what can wait. And focus on what you got done each day, not on what you weren't able to do. Ask your family or friends for support.    When should I ask my health care provider for help with stress? Get help if you're having severe symptoms for 2 weeks or more, including:   Trouble sleeping Changes in your eating that cause unwanted changes in your weight Troubles getting out of bed because of your mood Difficulty focusing your thoughts Losing interest in things you usually enjoy Not being able to do your usual daily activities   Always get help right away if stress is causing you to:    Have thoughts of suicide Feel you can't cope Use drugs or alcohol more often than usual   Your health care provider may refer you to a mental health professional such as a psychologist or social worker.

    "summary": "What is a stroke? A stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.   If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. Immediate treatment may save someone's life and increase the chances for successful rehabilitation and recovery.  What are the types of stroke? There are two types of stroke:  Ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot that blocks or plugs a blood vessel in the brain. This is the most common type; about 80% of strokes are ischemic.  Hemorrhagic stroke is caused by a blood vessel that breaks and bleeds into the brain.   Another condition that's similar to a stroke is a transient ischemic attack (TIA). It's sometimes called a \"mini-stroke.\" TIAs happen when the blood supply to the brain is blocked for a short time. The damage to the brain cells isn't permanent, but having a TIA puts you at much higher risk of having a stroke.  Who is at risk for a stroke? Certain factors can raise your risk of a stroke. The major risk factors include:   High blood pressure. This is the primary risk factor for a stroke. Diabetes. Heart diseases.Atrial fibrillation and other heart diseases can cause blood clots that lead to stroke. Smoking. When you smoke, you damage your blood vessels and raise your blood pressure. A personal or family history of stroke or TIA Age. Your risk of stroke increases as you get older. Race and ethnicity. People who are African Americans or  Hispanic have a higher risk of stroke.    There are also other factors that are linked to a higher risk of stroke, such as:  Alcohol and illegal drug use Not getting enough physical activity High cholesterol Unhealthy diet Having obesity   What are the symptoms of a stroke? The symptoms of a stroke often happen quickly. They include:  Sudden numbness or weakness of the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body) Sudden confusion, trouble speaking, or understanding speech Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes Sudden difficulty walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination Sudden severe headache with no known cause   The F.A.S.T. test can help you remember what to look for if you think someone is having a stroke. Think \"FAST\" and look for:   Face drooping on one side when smiling. Arm weakness occurs when the arms are raised, and one arm drifts downward. Speech is slurred or strange. Time to call 911.    If you think that you or someone else is having a stroke, call 911 right away. Every minute counts during a stroke.  How are strokes diagnosed? To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will   Ask about your symptoms and medical history  Do a physical exam, including a check of \t  \t\tYour mental alertness \t\tYour coordination and balance \t\tAny numbness or weakness in your face, arms, and legs \t\tAny trouble speaking and seeing clearly \t   Run some tests, which may include \t \t\tDiagnostic imaging of the brain, such as a CT scan or MRI. \t\tHeart tests, which can help detect heart problems or blood clots that may have led to a stroke. Possible tests include an electrocardiogram (EKG) and an echocardiography.  \t     What are the treatments for stroke? Treatments for stroke include medicines, surgery, and rehabilitation. Which treatments you get depend on the type of stroke and the stage of treatment. The different stages are:  Acute treatment, to try to stop a stroke while it is happening Post-stroke rehabilitation, to overcome the disabilities caused by the stroke Prevention, to prevent a first stroke or, if you have already had one, prevent another stroke   Acute treatments for ischemic stroke are usually medicines:   You may get tPA, (tissue plasminogen activator), a medicine to dissolve the blood clot. You can only get this medicine within 4 hours of when your symptoms started. The sooner you can get it, the better your chance of recovery.  If you cannot get that medicine, you may get medicine that helps stop platelets from clumping together to form blood clots. Or you may get a blood thinner to keep existing clots from getting bigger. If you have carotid artery disease, you may also need a procedure to open your blocked carotid artery.   Acute treatments for hemorrhagic stroke focus on stopping the bleeding. The first step is to find the cause of bleeding in the brain. The next step is to control it:     If high blood pressure is the cause of bleeding, you may be given blood pressure medicines. If an aneurysm is the cause, you may need aneurysm clipping or coil embolization. These are surgeries to prevent further leaking of blood from the aneurysm. It also can help prevent the aneurysm from bursting again. If an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is the cause of a stroke, you may need an AVM repair. An AVM is a tangle of faulty arteries and veins that can rupture within the brain.

The goal is to help you become as independent as possible and to have the best possible quality of life.  Prevention of another stroke is also important, since having a stroke increases the risk of getting another one. Prevention may include heart-healthy lifestyle changes and medicines.  Can strokes be prevented? If you have already had a stroke or are at risk of having a stroke, you can make some heart-healthy lifestyle changes to try to prevent a future stroke:  Eating a heart-healthy diet Aiming for a healthy weight Managing stress Getting regular physical activity Quitting smoking Managing your blood pressure and cholesterol levels   If these changes aren't enough, you may need medicine to control your risk factors.

    "summary": "What is stroke rehabilitation? Stroke rehabilitation is a program for people who have had a stroke. A stroke happens when there is a loss of blood flow to part of the brain. Your brain cells cannot get the oxygen and nutrients they need from blood, and they start to die within a few minutes. This can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death.   Stroke rehabilitation can help you relearn skills you lost because of the damage. It can help with movement, speech, strength, and daily living skills. The goal is to help you become as independent as possible.   Who needs stroke rehabilitation? Rehabilitation is for people who have lost abilities needed for daily life. Stroke rehabilitation is recommended for anyone affected by stroke. Most people who take part in a treatment program recover better than those who don't.   The effects of a stroke depend on the parts of your brain that were affected. Your health care provider may recommend care based on your needs.   The types of disabilities a stroke can cause include:   Paralysis or problems controlling movement Pain or other problems with your senses Problems using or understanding language Problems with thinking and memory Difficulty with controlling or expressing emotions    When should stroke rehabilitation begin? The sooner you begin rehabilitation, the more likely you are to regain lost skills and abilities. Treatment may start while you're still in the hospital. Most likely it will begin within 24 to 48 hours after the stroke.   What does stroke rehabilitation include? The goal of rehabilitation is to help you get your abilities back and regain independence. But the specific goals vary for each person. Your treatment plan will depend on what part of your body or type of ability was affected by the stroke. It may include teaching you new ways to work with disabilities, such as using assistive devices to make it easier to do your usual activities.    A plan for stroke rehabilitation can involve many kinds of health professionals. They will work with you to figure out your needs, goals, and make a treatment plan. The types of treatments can include:  Speech-language therapy. To help with speaking, understanding, reading, writing, and swallowing.  Physical therapy. To help you relearn movement and coordination skills, regain strength, and stretch your muscles. Occupational therapy. To help improve your ability to perform daily living skills such as eating, drinking, bathing, and dressing. Cognitive therapy. To help you relearn or improve skills such as thinking, learning, memory, planning, and decision making.   Mental health counseling. Therapy, medicine, or joining a patient support group may be recommended to help you cope with emotional or behavioral issues.  Medicine. To treat pain, other health issues, or to help with depression or other mental health conditions following a stroke. Vocational rehabilitation. To help you build skills for going to school or working at a job.   Where does stroke rehabilitation take place? Rehabilitation may start while you're in the hospital. Once you're ready for discharge, you and your family will work with your provider to determine the best setting for your specific needs. These can include:  An inpatient rehabilitation clinic  A home-based program  An outpatient unit  A skilled nursing facility     How long does stroke rehabilitation last? A stroke can cause various complications, and each person may recover at a different pace. The length of rehabilitation will depend on how bad the stroke was and any related complications.   Some people recover quickly after a stroke, but most people need some type of long-term rehabilitation. This can change as you progress and your needs change. Your willingness to work toward improvement and the support of your family and health care team will help you get the best results.   NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",

    "disease": "Stuttering",
    "summary": "What is stuttering?  Stuttering is a speech disorder. It involves interruptions in the flow of speech. These interruptions are called disfluencies. They may involve: Repeating sounds, syllables, or words Stretching out a sound Suddenly stopping in the middle of a syllable or word  Sometimes, along with the stuttering, there may be nodding, rapid blinking, or trembling lips. The stuttering may be worse when you are stressed, excited, or tired. Stuttering can be frustrating, because you know exactly what you want to say, but you have trouble saying it. It can make it difficult to communicate with people. This can cause problems with school, work, and relationships.  What causes stuttering? There are two main types of stuttering, and they have different causes: Developmental stuttering is the more common type. It starts in young children while they are still learning speech and language skills. Many children stutter when they first start talking. Most of them will outgrow it. But some continue to stutter, and the exact cause is unknown. There are differences in the brains of people who continue to stutter. Genetics may also play a role, since this type of stuttering can run in families. Neurogenic stuttering can happen after someone has a stroke, head trauma, or other type of brain injury. Because of the injury, the brain has trouble coordinating the different parts of the brain involved in speech.   Who is at risk for stuttering? Stuttering can affect anyone, but it is much more common in boys than girls. Younger children are most likely to stutter. About 75% of children who stutter will get better. For the rest, stuttering can continue their whole lives.  How is stuttering diagnosed? Stuttering is usually diagnosed by a speech-language pathologist. This is a health professional who is trained to test and treat people with voice, speech, and language disorders. If you or your child stutters, your regular health care provider may give you a referral to a speech-language pathologist. Or in some cases, a child's teacher may make a referral. To make a diagnosis, the speech-language pathologist will:  Look at the case history, such as when the stuttering was first noticed, how often it happens, and in what situations it happens Listen to you or your child speak and analyze the stuttering Evaluate you or your child's speech and language abilities, including the ability to understand and use language Ask about the impact of stuttering on you or your child's life Ask whether stuttering runs in the family For a child, consider how likely it is that he or she will outgrow it   What are the treatments for stuttering? There are different treatments that can help with stuttering. Some of these may help one person but not another. You need to work with the speech-language pathologist to figure out the best plan for you or your child.  The plan should take into account how long the stuttering has been going on and whether there are any other speech or language problems. For a child, the plan should also take into account your child's age and whether he or she is likely to outgrow the stuttering. Younger children may not need therapy right away. Their parents and teachers can learn strategies to help the child practice speaking. That can help some children. As a parent, it's important to be calm and relaxed when your child is speaking. If your child feels pressured, it can make it harder for them to talk. The speech-language pathologist will probably want to evaluate your child regularly, to see whether treatment is needed. Speech therapy can help children and adults minimize stuttering. Some techniques include: Speaking more slowly Controlling breathing Gradually working up from single-syllable responses to longer words and more complex sentences  For adults, self-help groups can help you find resources and support as you face the challenges of stuttering. There are electronic devices to help with fluency, but more research is needed to see whether they really help over the long term. Some people have tried medicines that usually treat other health problems such as epilepsy, anxiety, or depression. But these medicines are not approved for stuttering, and they often have side effects.  NIH: National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders",

    "disease": "Sudden Cardiac Arrest",
    "summary": "What is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)?  Sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) is a condition in which the heart suddenly stops beating. When that happens, blood stops flowing to the brain and other vital organs. If it is not treated, SCA usually causes death within minutes. But quick treatment with a defibrillator may be lifesaving.  How is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) different from a heart attack? A heart attack is different from an SCA. A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart is blocked. During a heart attack, the heart usually doesn't suddenly stop beating. With an SCA, the heart stops beating.    Sometimes an SCA can happen after or during recovery from a heart attack.  What causes sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? Your heart has an electrical system that controls the rate and rhythm of your heartbeat.  An SCA can happen when the heart's electrical system is not working right and causes irregular heartbeats. Irregular heartbeats are called arrhythmias. There are different types. They may cause the heart to beat too fast, too slow, or with an irregular rhythm. Some can cause the heart to stop pumping blood to the body; this is the type that causes SCA.  Certain diseases and conditions can cause the electrical problems that lead to SCA. They include: Ventricular fibrillation, a type of arrhythmia where the ventricles (the heart's lower chambers) don't beat normally. Instead, they beat very fast and very irregularly. They can't pump blood to the body. This causes most SCAs. Coronary artery disease (CAD), also called ischemic heart disease. CAD happens when the arteries of the heart cannot deliver enough oxygen-rich blood to the heart. It is often caused by the buildup of plaque, a waxy substance, inside the lining of larger coronary arteries. The plaque blocks some or all of the blood flow to the heart. Some types of physical stress can cause your heart's electrical system to fail, such as \t \tIntense physical activity in which your body releases the hormone adrenaline. This hormone can trigger SCA in people who have heart problems. \tVery low blood levels of potassium or magnesium. These minerals play an important role in your heart's electrical system. \tMajor blood loss \tSevere lack of oxygen \t  Certain inherited disorders which can cause arrhythmias or problems with the structure of your heart Structural changes in the heart, such as an enlarged heart due to high blood pressure or advanced heart disease. Heart infections can also cause changes to the structure of the heart.   Who is at risk for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? You are at higher risk for SCA if you: Have coronary artery disease (CAD). Most people with SCA have CAD. But CAD usually doesn't cause symptoms, so they may not know that they have it. Are older; your risk increases with age Are a man; it is more common in men than women Are Black or African American, especially if you have other conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease Have a personal history of heartbeats that aren't regular (arrhythmia) Have a personal or family history of SCA or inherited disorders that can cause arrhythmia Have a problem with drug or alcohol use Have had a heart attack Have heart failure   What are the symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? Usually, the first sign of SCA is loss of consciousness (fainting). This happens when the heart stops beating.  Some people may have a racing heartbeat or feel dizzy or light-headed just before they faint. And sometimes people have chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea, or vomiting in the hour before they have an SCA.  How is sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) diagnosed? SCA happens without warning and requires emergency treatment. Health care providers rarely diagnose SCA with medical tests as it's happening. Instead, it is usually diagnosed after it happens. Providers do this by ruling out other causes of a person's sudden collapse.  If you are at high risk for SCA, your provider may refer you to a cardiologist, a doctor who specializes in heart diseases. The cardiologist may ask you to get various heart health tests to see how well you heart is working. He or she will work with you to decide whether you need treatment to prevent SCA.  What are the treatments for sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)?  SCA is an emergency. A person having SCA needs to be treated with a defibrillator right away. A defibrillator is a device sends an electric shock to the heart. The electric shock can restore a normal rhythm to a heart that's stopped beating. To work well, it needs to be done within minutes of the SCA.  Most police officers, emergency medical technicians, and other first responders are trained and equipped to use a defibrillator. Call 9-1-1 right away if someone has signs or symptoms of SCA. The sooner you call for help, the sooner lifesaving treatment can begin.  What should I do if I think that someone has had an SCA?  Many public places such as schools, businesses, and airports have automated external defibrillators (AEDs). AEDs are special defibrillators that untrained people can use if they think that someone has had SCA. AEDS are programmed to give an electric shock if they detect a dangerous arrhythmia. This prevents giving a shock to someone who may have fainted but isn't having SCA.   If you see someone who you think has had SCA, you should give cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) until defibrillation can be done.  People who are at risk for SCA may want to consider having an AED at home. Ask your cardiologist to help you decide whether having an AED in your home might help you.  What are the treatments after surviving sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)? If you survive SCA, you'll likely be admitted to a hospital for ongoing care and treatment. In the hospital, your medical team will closely watch your heart. They may give you medicines to try to reduce the risk of another SCA.   They will also try to find out what caused your SCA. If you're diagnosed with coronary artery disease, you may have an angioplasty or coronary artery bypass surgery. These procedures help restore blood flow through narrowed or blocked coronary arteries.  Often, people who have had SCA get a device called an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). This small device is surgically placed under the skin in your chest or abdomen. An ICD uses electric pulses or shocks to help control dangerous arrhythmias.  Can sudden cardiac arrest (SCA) be prevented? You may be able to lower your risk of SCA by following a heart-healthy lifestyle. If you have coronary artery disease or another heart disease, treating that disease can also lower your risk of SCA. If you have had an SCA, getting an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) can lower your chance of having another SCA.  NIH: National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute",

A suicide attempt is when someone harms themselves to try to end their life, but they do not die. Suicide is a major public health problem and a leading cause of death in the United States. Both suicide and suicide attempts can have lasting harmful effects:  People who survive a suicide attempt may have serious injuries that can affect their long-term health. They may also have depression or other mental health concerns. When people die by suicide, it affects their family, friends, and community. They may feel grief, shock, anger, and guilt. Some may develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, or anxiety. They may also be at risk for suicidal thoughts.    Who is at risk for suicide? Suicide does not discriminate. It can touch anyone, anywhere, at any time. But there are certain factors that can contribute to the risk of suicide, including: Having attempted suicide before Depression and other mental health disorders Alcohol or drug use disorder Family history of a mental health disorder Family history of an alcohol or drug use disorder Family history of suicide Family violence, including intimate partner violence, child abuse, or sexual abuse Having guns in the home Being in or having recently gotten out of prison or jail Being exposed to others' suicidal behavior, such as a family member, peer, or celebrity Medical illness, including chronic pain Stressful life event, such as a job loss, financial problems, loss of a loved one, a breakup of a relationship, etc. Being between the ages of 15 and 24 years or over age 60   What are the warning signs for suicide? The warning signs for suicide include: Talking about wanting to die or wanting to kill oneself Making a plan or looking for a way to kill oneself, such as searching online Buying a gun or stockpiling pills Feeling empty, hopeless, trapped, or like there's no reason to live Being in unbearable pain Talking about being a burden to others Using more alcohol or drugs Acting anxious or agitated; behaving recklessly Sleeping too little or too much Withdrawing from family or friends or feeling isolated Showing rage or talking about seeking revenge Displaying extreme mood swings Saying good-bye to loved ones, putting affairs in order   Some people may tell others about their suicidal thoughts.

    "summary": "Can a tan be healthy? Some people think that tanning gives them a healthy glow. But tanning, either outdoors or indoors with a tanning bed, is not healthy at all. It exposes you to harmful rays and puts you at risk for health problems such as melanoma and other skin cancers.  What are UV rays, and how do they affect the skin? Sunlight travels to earth as a mixture of both visible and invisible rays. Some of the rays are harmless to people. But one kind, ultraviolet (UV) rays, can cause problems. They are a form of radiation. UV rays do help your body make vitamin D, but too much exposure damages your skin. Most people can get the vitamin D that they need with only about 5 to 15 minutes of sun exposure two to three times a week.  There are three types of UV rays. Two of them, UVA and UVB, can reach the earth's surface and affect your skin. Using a tanning bed also exposes you to UVA and UVB.   UVB rays can cause sunburn. UVA rays can travel more deeply into the skin than UVB rays. When your skin is exposed to UVA, it tries to protect itself from further damage. It does this by making more melanin, which is the skin pigment that makes your skin darker. That's what gives you a tan. This means that your tan is a sign of skin damage.  What are the health risks of tanning? Since tanning means overexposure to UV rays, it can damage your skin and cause health problems such as: Premature skin aging, which can cause your skin to become thickened, leathery, and wrinkled. You may also have dark spots on your skin. These happen because long-term exposure to UV rays makes your skin less elastic. The more sun exposure you have, the earlier your skin ages. Skin cancers, including melanoma. This can happen because the UV light damages the DNA of your skin cells and interferes with your body's ability to fight the cancer.  Actinic keratosis, a thick, scaly patch of skin that usually forms on areas exposed to the sun, such as the face, scalp, back of the hands, or chest. It can eventually become cancerous. Eye damage, including cataracts and photokeratitis (snow blindness) A weakened immune system, which can increase your sensitivity to sunlight, decrease the effects of vaccines, and cause you to have reactions to certain medicines.   What should I do to protect my skin from UV rays?  Limit sun exposure. Try to stay out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when its rays are strongest. But remember that you still get sun exposure when you are outside on cloudy days or are in the shade. Use sunscreen with sun protective factor (SPF) 15 or higher. It should also be a broad-spectrum sunscreen, which means that it gives you both UVA and UVB protection. If you have very light skin, use SPF 30 or higher. Apply sunscreen 20-30 minutes before going outside and reapply it at least every 2 hours. Wear sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB rays. Wrap-around sunglasses work best because they block UV rays from sneaking in from the side. Wear a hat. You can get the best protection with a wide-brimmed hat that is made out of a tightly woven fabric, such as canvas. Wear protective clothing such as long-sleeved shirts and long pants and skirts. Clothes made from tightly woven fabric offer the best protection.   It is also important to check your skin once a month. If you do see any new or changing spots or moles, go see your health care provider.  Isn't indoor tanning safer than tanning in the sun? Indoor tanning is not better than tanning in the sun; it also exposes you to UV rays and damages your skin. Tanning beds use UVA light, so they expose you to a higher concentration of UVA rays than you would get by tanning in the sun. Tanning lights also expose you to some UVB rays.   Some people think that getting a \"base tan\" in a tanning salon can protect you when you go in the sun. But a \"base tan\" causes damage to your skin and will not prevent you from getting sunburn when you go outside.  Indoor tanning is particularly dangerous for younger people. You have a higher risk of melanoma if you started doing indoor tanning while you were a teen or young adult.  Some research shows that frequent tanning may even be addictive. This can be dangerous because the more often you tan, the more damage you do to your skin.  Are there safer ways to look tan? There are other ways to look tan, but they are not all safe: Tanning pills have a color additive that turns your skin orange after you take them. But they can be dangerous and are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sunless tanners have no known risk for skin cancer, but you do have to be careful. Most spray tans, lotions, and gels use DHA, a color additive that makes your skin look tan. DHA is considered safe for use on the outside of your body by the FDA. You need to make sure it doesn't get into your nose, eyes, or mouth. If you use a spray tan, be careful not to breathe in the spray. Also, remember that these \"tans\" do not protect you from UV rays when you go outside.",

Your doctor can first make sure that you do not have another health problem that is causing your depression. To do this, you may have a physical exam and lab tests.  If you don't have another health problem, you will get a psychological evaluation. Your doctor may do it, or you may be referred to a mental health professional to get one. You may be asked about things such as: Your thoughts and feelings How you are doing at school Any changes in your eating, sleeping, or energy level Whether you are suicidal Whether you use alcohol or drugs   How is depression in teens treated? Effective treatments for depression in teens include talk therapy, or a combination of talk therapy and medicines:  Talk therapy Talk therapy, also called psychotherapy or counseling, can help you understand and manage your moods and feelings. It involves going to see a therapist, such as a psychiatrist, a psychologist, a social worker, or counselor. You can talk out your emotions to someone who understands and supports you.

There are a few antidepressants that have been widely studied and proven to help teens. If you are taking medicine for depression, it is important to see your doctor regularly.   It is also important to know that it will take some time for you to get relief from antidepressants: It can take 3 to 4 weeks until an antidepressant takes effect You may have to try more than one antidepressant to find one that works for you It can also take some time to find the right dose of an antidepressant   In some cases, teenagers may have an increase in suicidal thoughts or behavior when taking antidepressants. This risk is higher in the first few weeks after starting the medicine and when the dose is changed. Make sure to tell your parents or guardian if you start feeling worse or have thoughts of hurting yourself.  You should not stop taking the antidepressants on your own. You need to work with your doctor to slowly and safely decrease the dose before you stop.  Programs for severe depression Some teens who have severe depression or are at risk of hurting themselves may need more intensive treatment. They may go into a psychiatric hospital or do a day program. Both offer counseling, group discussions, and activities with mental health professionals and other patients. Day programs may be full-day or half-day, and they often last for several weeks.",

    "summary": "What is teen sexual health? Teen sexual health is about how sex affects your physical and emotional health. It means knowing how to form healthy relationships and making decisions about sex that are right for you.  As your body changes during puberty, how you think, feel, and interact with others also changes. You may have new feelings and thoughts about sex. Understanding who you're becoming as a sexual young adult is also part of teen sexual health.     For all teens, taking responsibility for sexual health is part of growing up. Whether you choose to have sex or wait, responsibility includes knowing about: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) Birth control What a healthy relationship is   What are sexually transmitted infections (STIs)? Sexually transmitted infections (STIs), or sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), are caused by bacteria, viruses, and parasites that spread from person to person, usually during vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Some STIs are spread by skin-to-skin contact. Without treatment, some STIs can cause long-term health problems.  There are more than 20 types of STIs, including: Chlamydia Genital herpes Gonorrhea HIV HPV (human papillomavirus) Pubic lice Syphilis Trichomoniasis   STIs don't always cause symptoms. So it is possible to have an infection without knowing it and then pass it on to someone else. The only way to know for sure whether you have an STI is to get tested.  How can I reduce my chances of getting a sexually transmitted infection (STI)? The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have vaginal, oral, or anal sex. Saying \"no\" to sex is the right choice for many teens.    If you decide to have sex, \"safer sex\" practices will lower your chance of getting an STI. They include: Talking with your partner about preventing STIs and getting tested before having sex. If you can't talk about STIs, you aren't ready to have sex. Getting the HPV vaccine. You can be vaccinated between ages 9 and 26. Using condoms correctly every time you have vaginal, oral, or anal sex:     External (male) latex condoms provide the best protection against STIs. If you or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms.  Internal (female) condoms, made of nitrile, are placed inside the body (vagina or anus). They may be less effective against STIs than latex external condoms.  Don't use both type of condoms together because that increases the chance they'll rip  Use a dental dam (a square piece of latex, polyurethane, or nitrile) to protect the mouth during oral sex   Having sex with only one person who has sex only with you (mutual monogamy). But first, both of you should get tested for STIs. Not mixing alcohol or drugs with sex. You need to think clearly to make safer choices about sex.   How can I reduce the chance of pregnancy? The only sure way to avoid pregnancy is not to have vaginal sex.  If you decide to have vaginal sex, birth control can help prevent pregnancy. There are many types of birth control that work in different ways.  Your health care provider can help you choose birth control that's best for you.  Condoms are the only birth control method that protects against STIs. But condoms alone aren't the most effective form of birth control. It's safest to use condoms with another form of birth control to prevent both STIs and pregnancy.  What is a healthy relationship? Healthy sex starts with a healthy relationship, so it's important to take an honest look at how you and your partner treat each other. Your relationship may be healthy if it includes: Respect. You and your partner value each other's feelings. Neither of you pressure the other to do things they don't want to do. Trust and honesty. You always tell the truth and trust your partner to do the same.  Good communication. You feel safe talking openly about your feelings, STIs, and other relationships. And you both listen.   Your relationship may be unhealthy if it includes: Jealousy and control. One of you wants to make all the decisions and tries to keep the other from spending time with their friends and family. Disrespect. One of you makes fun of the other person's ideas and feelings.  Pressure. One of you tries to bully the other into doing sexual things they don't want to do.  Violence. Hitting, shoving, grabbing, and sexual assault should never be part of a relationship. If you don't know how to end a violent relationship, get help.   Your decisions about sex can affect your future health. Make sure that you know the facts so you can decide what is right for you.",

However, in some cases they can become chronic (long lasting)  What causes temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)? Sometimes an injury to the jaw or TMJ can cause a TMD. But in most cases, the cause is not known. Research suggests that certain factors may play a role in why a TMD starts and whether it will be long lasting:  Genetics  Psychological and life stressors How someone perceives pain   Who is more likely to develop a temporomandibular disorder (TMD)?  Anyone can develop a TMD, but it is more common in women than in men. It is most common in women between 35 and 44 years old.  What are the symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)? The symptoms of TMDs may include:  Pain in the chewing muscles and/or jaw joint. This is the most common symptom. Pain that spreads to the face or neck. Jaw stiffness. Limited movement or locking of the jaw. Painful clicking or popping in your jaw joint when you open or close your mouth. However, clicking or popping without pain is common and is not a sign of a TMD. Tinnitus (ringing in the ears), hearing loss, or dizziness. A change in the way the upper and lower teeth fit together.   How are temporomandibular disorders (TMDs) diagnosed? There is no standard test used to diagnose TMDs, and some other conditions can cause some similar symptoms. This can make TMDs hard to diagnose. To find out if you have a TMD, your health care provider or dentist:  Will take a detailed medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. They will want to know: \t \t\tWhere the pain is  \t\tWhen you have it \t\tWhat makes it better or worse \t\tIf it stays in one area or spreads to other parts of your body \t\tIf you have any other pain conditions such as headache or back pain \t  Will examine your head, neck, face, and jaw for: \t \t\tTenderness \t\tJaw clicking or popping \t\tProblems moving your jaw \t  May order imaging studies such as an x-ray, MRI, or CT   What are the treatments for temporomandibular disorders (TMDs)? For many people, the symptoms of TMD are temporary. To help you feel better, your provider or dentist may suggest that you:  Eat soft foods. Apply heat or cold to the face and do some exercises to gently stretch and strengthen your jaw muscles. Take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like ibuprofen. Stop clenching your jaw, chewing gum, and biting your nails.   If those do not help, your provider or dentist may suggest other treatments such as:  Physical therapy Self-management and behavioral health approaches, which can include: \t \t\tCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type of psychotherapy. It can help you identify negative thoughts and change them. It can also teach you coping skills. \t\tBiofeedback, which involves using electronic devices to teach you to control certain body functions, such as your heartbeat, blood pressure, and muscle tension. For example, it can detect when you tighten your jaw muscles. You can learn how to recognize when this happens and then relax your muscles.  \t  Medicines such as: \t \t\tAnti-anxiety medicines \t\tAntidepressants \t\tAnti-seizure medicines \t\tPrescription pain relievers \t  An intraoral appliance, which is a device that fits over your teeth. Types of intraoral appliances include oral splints and mouth guards. If you are going to use one, it's important to:  \t \t\tKnow that there is not a lot of evidence that they improve TMD pain.  \t\tMake sure that the appliance you have is not designed to permanently change your bite. \t\tLet your provider or dentist know if it makes your pain worse. \t  Complementary treatments, which are treatments that are used along with mainstream medical care. There is limited evidence showing that they help with TMD symptoms. But some providers and dentists may recommend acupuncture and transcutaneous electrical stimulation (TENS). TENS involves using a device to send a gentle electric current to your nerves or muscles. It may help treat pain by interrupting or blocking the pain signals.    If you are still having severe symptoms from a TMD, your provider or dentist may suggest surgery, including implant surgery, or another procedure.   It's important to be careful, because sometimes surgery or another procedure may not work or may even make your symptoms worse. Before any surgery or other procedure, it is very important to get opinions from more than one provider and to completely understand the risks.

What are the treatments for testicular cancer? Testicular cancer can usually be cured.The treatment options include:  Surgery (if the testicle has not already been removed during diagnosis). Radiation therapy. Chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant. Surveillance, which might be done after surgery. It means that your provider will closely follow your condition with regular exams and tests. You won't get any further treatment unless there are changes in your test results.   Some of the treatments may also cause infertility. If you may want to have children later on, you should consider sperm banking before treatment.  After you have finished your treatment, you will need regular follow-up testing to make sure that the cancer has not come back. If you have had cancer in one testicle, you have a higher risk of getting cancer in the other testicle. So it's important to check the other testicle regularly and let your provider know if you notice any changes or unusual symptoms.   NIH: National Cancer Institute",

    "summary": "What are ticks? Ticks are small parasites. They may look like insects, but they have eight legs and are related to spiders. Ticks feed on the blood of people and warm-blooded animals. There are many types of ticks in the United States, and they live in different parts of the country.   Ticks can be different colors and sizes. They can be light-colored, reddish brown, or dark brown. Some ticks are so small that they can be difficult to see. Ticks may get on you if you walk though areas where they live, such as tall grass, leaf litter or shrubs.   Why do I need to be worried about tick bites? If you spend time outdoors or have pets that go outdoors, you need to beware of ticks. When they bite, certain types of ticks can pass on germs that cause different diseases. Sometimes the symptoms can be mild. In other cases, you can have serious, long-lasting health problems. Some of the diseases you can get from a tick bite (called tickborne diseases) include:   Lyme disease Alpha-gal syndrome (tick bite red meat allergy) Babesiosis Ehrlichiosis Rocky Mountain spotted fever Tularemia   What happens if I get bitten by a tick? You may not feel it when a tick bites you. The tick can stay attached to your body for several days. If that tick is infected, it can pass along any germs to you once it starts sucking your blood. But if you catch it and remove it before it has filled up on your blood, you are less likely to get infected.  How do I remove a tick? If you find a tick attached to your skin, remove the tick as soon as you can. You could use a tick removal device or a fine-tipped tweezers:  Using the tweezers, grab the tick as close to your skin as possible. Pull upward with steady, even pressure. Don't twist or jerk the tick. You want to remove the whole tick in one piece if you can. If the mouth-parts of the tick break off and stay in the skin, try to remove them. But if you can't remove them easily, then leave them. Thoroughly clean the bite area and your hands with rubbing alcohol or soap and water.   When do I need to contact my health care provider about a tick bite? Many tickborne diseases can have similar signs and symptoms. The most common are:  Fever Chills Aches and pains Rash   If you develop any of these symptoms within several weeks of removing a tick, contact your provider.  How can I prevent tick bites? There are steps you can take to prevent tick bites:  Avoid wooded, brushy, and grassy areas, especially during warmer months. Wear insect repellent with DEET, picaridin or another U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent. Wear light-colored protective clothing. Treat your clothing and gear with products containing 0.5% permethrin. Tuck your pant legs into your socks and your shirt into your pants. Remove your clothing after being outdoors. Check your clothing for ticks and remove any ticks that you find. Wash and dry your clothes at high temperatures. Check yourself, your children, and your pets daily for ticks and carefully remove any ticks you find.",

The lymphatic system clears away infection and keeps body fluids in balance.  Tonsils and adenoids work by trapping the germs coming in through the mouth and nose.  What is tonsillitis? Tonsillitis is an inflammation (swelling) of the tonsils. Sometimes along with tonsillitis, the adenoids are also swollen.  What causes tonsillitis? The cause of tonsillitis is usually a viral infection. Bacterial infections such as strep throat can also cause tonsillitis.   Who is at risk for tonsillitis? Tonsillitis is most common in children over age two. Almost every child in the United States gets it at least once. Tonsillitis caused by bacteria is more common in kids ages 5-15. Tonsillitis caused by a virus is more common in younger children.  Adults can get tonsillitis, but it is not very common.  Is tonsillitis contagious? Although tonsillitis is not contagious, the viruses and bacteria that cause it are contagious. Frequent handwashing can help prevent spreading or catching the infections.  What are the symptoms of tonsillitis? The symptoms of tonsillitis include: A sore throat, which may be severe Red, swollen tonsils Trouble swallowing A white or yellow coating on the tonsils Swollen glands in the neck Fever Bad breath   When does my child need to see a health care provider for tonsillitis? You should call your health care provider if your child: Has a sore throat for more than two days Has trouble or pain when swallowing Feels very sick or very weak   You should get emergency care right away if your child: Has trouble breathing Starts drooling Has a lot of trouble swallowing   How is tonsillitis diagnosed? To diagnose tonsillitis, your child's health care provider will first ask you about your child's symptoms and medical history. The provider will look at your child's throat and neck, checking for things such as redness or white spots on the tonsils and swollen lymph nodes.  Your child will probably also have one or more tests to check for strep throat, since it can cause tonsillitis and it requires treatment. It could be a rapid strep test, a throat culture, or both. For both tests, the provider uses a cotton swab to collect a sample of fluids from your child's tonsils and the back of the throat. With the rapid strep test, testing is done in the office, and you get the results within minutes. The throat culture is done in a lab, and it usually takes a few days to get the results. The throat culture is a more reliable test. So sometimes if the rapid strep test is negative (meaning that it does not show any strep bacteria), the provider will also do a throat culture just to make sure that your child does not have strep.  What are the treatments for tonsillitis? Treatment for tonsillitis depends on the cause. If the cause is a virus, there is no medicine to treat it. If the cause is a bacterial infection, such as strep throat, your child will need to take antibiotics. It is important for your child to finish the antibiotics even if he or she feels better. If treatment stops too soon, some bacteria may survive and re-infect your child.  No matter what is causing the tonsillitis, there are some things you can do to help your child feel better. Make sure that your child: Gets a lot of rest Drinks plenty of fluids Tries eating soft foods if it hurts to swallow Tries eating warm liquids or cold foods like popsicles to soothe the throat Isn't around cigarette smoke or anything else that could irritate the throat Sleeps in a room with a humidifier Gargles with saltwater Sucks on a lozenge (but do not give them to children under four; they can choke on them) Takes an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen. Children and teenagers should not take aspirin.   In some cases, your child may need a tonsillectomy.  What is a tonsillectomy and why might my child need one? A tonsillectomy is surgery to remove the tonsils. Your child might need it if he or she: Keeps getting tonsillitis Has bacterial tonsillitis that does not get better with antibiotics Has tonsils that are too big and are causing trouble breathing or swallowing   Your child usually gets the surgery and goes home later that day. Very young children and people who have complications may need to stay in the hospital overnight. It can take a week or two before your child completely recovers from the surgery.",

    "disease": "Tooth Decay",
    "summary": "What is tooth decay?  Tooth decay is damage to a tooth's surface, or enamel. It happens when bacteria in your mouth make acids that attack the enamel. Tooth decay can lead to cavities (dental caries), which are holes in your teeth. If tooth decay is not treated, it can cause pain, infection, and even tooth loss.  What causes tooth decay?  Our mouths are full of bacteria. Some bacteria are helpful. But some can be harmful, including the ones that play a role in tooth decay. These bacteria combine with food to form a soft, sticky film called plaque. The bacteria in plaque use the sugar and starch in what you eat and drink to make acids. The acids begin to eat away at the minerals on your enamel. Over time, the plaque can harden into tartar. Besides damaging your teeth, plaque and tartar can also irritate your gums and cause gum disease. You get fluoride from toothpaste, water, and other sources. This fluoride, along with your salvia, helps the enamel repair itself by replacing the minerals. Your teeth go through this natural process of losing minerals and regaining minerals all day long. But if you don't take care of your teeth and/or you eat and drink lots of sugary or starchy things, your enamel will keep losing minerals. This leads to tooth decay. A white spot may appear where minerals have been lost. This is an early sign of tooth decay. You may be able to stop or reverse the decay at this point. Your enamel can still repair itself, if you take better care of your teeth and limit sugary/starchy foods and drinks. But if the tooth decay process continues, more minerals are lost. Over time, the enamel is weakened and destroyed, forming a cavity. A cavity is a hole in your tooth. It is permanent damage that a dentist has to repair with a filling.  Who is at risk for tooth decay?  The main risk factors for tooth decay are not taking care of your teeth and having too many sugary or starchy foods and drinks.  Some people have a higher risk of tooth decay, including people who: Don't have enough saliva, because of medicines, certain diseases, or some cancer treatments Don't get enough fluoride Are very young. Babies and toddlers who drink from bottles are at risk, especially if they are given juice or get bottles at bedtime. This exposes their teeth to sugars for long periods of time. Are older. Many older adults have receding gums and more wear on their teeth. These raise the risk of decay on the exposed root surfaces of their teeth.   What are the symptoms of tooth decay and cavities?  In early tooth decay, you usually don't have symptoms. As tooth decay gets worse, it can cause:  A toothache (tooth pain) Tooth sensitivity to sweets, hot, or cold White or brown stains on the surface of a tooth A cavity An infection, which can lead to an abscess (pocket of pus) forming. The abscess can cause pain, facial swelling, and fever.   How are tooth decay and cavities diagnosed?  Dentists usually find tooth decay and cavities by looking at your teeth and probing them with dental instruments. Your dentist will also ask if you have any symptoms. Sometimes you may need a dental x-ray.  What are the treatments for tooth decay and cavities?  There are several treatments for tooth decay and cavities. Which treatment you get depends on how bad the problem is: Fluoride treatments. If you have early tooth decay, a fluoride treatment can help the enamel to repair itself. Fillings. If you have a typical cavity, your dentist will remove the decayed tooth tissue and then restore the tooth by filling it with a filling material. Root canal. If the damage to the tooth and/or an infection spreads to the pulp (inside of the tooth), you might need a root canal. Your dentist will remove the decayed pulp and clean inside the tooth and root. The next step is to fill the tooth with a temporary filling. Then you will need to come back to get a permanent filling or a crown (a cover on the tooth). Extraction (pulling the tooth). In the most severe cases, when the damage to the pulp cannot be fixed, your dentist may pull the tooth. Your dentist will suggest that you get a bridge or implant to replace the missing tooth. Otherwise, the teeth next to the gap may move over and change your bite.   Can tooth decay be prevented?  There are steps that you can take to prevent tooth decay: Make sure that you get enough fluoride by \t \tBrushing with a fluoride toothpaste \tDrinking tap water with fluoride. Most bottled water does not contain fluoride. \tUsing fluoride mouth rinse \t  Practice good oral health by brushing your teeth twice a day with a fluoride toothpaste and regularly flossing your teeth Make smart food choices by limiting foods and drinks that are high in sugars and starches. Eat nutritious, balanced meals and limit snacking. Do not use tobacco products, including smokeless tobacco. If you currently use tobacco, consider quitting. See a dentist for regular check-ups and professional cleanings Make sure that your children get sealants on their teeth. Dental sealants are thin plastic coatings that protect the chewing surfaces of the back teeth. Children should get sealants on their back teeth as soon as they come in, before decay can attack the teeth.   NIH: National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research",

There are four parts: Enamel, your tooth's hard surface Dentin, the hard yellow part under the enamel Cementum, the hard tissue that covers the root and keeps your teeth in place Pulp, the soft connective tissue in the center of your tooth. It contains nerves and blood vessels.   You need your teeth for many activities that you may take for granted. These include eating, speaking and even smiling.  What are tooth disorders? There are many different problems that can affect your teeth, including: Tooth decay - damage to a tooth's surface, which can lead to cavities Abscess - a pocket of pus, caused by a tooth infection Impacted tooth - a tooth that did not erupt (break through the gum) when it should have. It is usually wisdom teeth that are impacted, but it can sometimes happen to other teeth. Misaligned teeth (malocclusion) Tooth injuries such as broken or chipped teeth   What causes tooth disorders? The causes of tooth disorders varies, depending on the problem. Sometimes the cause is not taking good care of your teeth. In other cases, you may have been born with the problem or the cause is an accident.  What are the symptoms of tooth disorders? The symptoms can vary, depending on the problem. Some of the more common symptoms include: Abnormal color or shape of the tooth Tooth pain Worn-down teeth   How are tooth disorders diagnosed? Your dentist will ask about your symptoms, look at your teeth, and probe them with dental instruments. In some cases, you may need dental x-rays.  What are the treatments for tooth disorders?

    "summary": "What is traumatic brain injury (TBI)?  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a sudden injury that causes damage to the brain. It may happen when there is a blow, bump, or jolt to the head. This is a closed head injury. A TBI can also happen when an object penetrates the skull. This is a penetrating injury.   Symptoms of a TBI can be mild, moderate, or severe. Concussions are a type of mild TBI. The effects of a concussion can sometimes be serious, but most people completely recover in time. More severe TBI can lead to serious physical and psychological symptoms, coma, and even death.  What causes traumatic brain injury (TBI)? The main causes of TBI depend on the type of head injury: Some of the common causes of a closed head injury include  \t \t\tFalls. This is the most common cause in adults age 65 and older. \t\tMotor vehicle crashes. This is the most common cause in young adults. \t\tSports injuries \t\tBeing struck by an object \t\tChild abuse. This is the most common cause in children under age 4. \t\tBlast injuries due to explosions \t  Some of the common causes of a penetrating injury include  \t \t\tBeing hit by a bullet or shrapnel \t\tBeing hit by a weapon such as a hammer, knife, or baseball bat \t\tA head injury that causes a bone fragment to penetrate the skull \t \t  Some accidents such as explosions, natural disasters, or other extreme events can cause both closed and penetrating TBI in the same person.  Who is at risk for traumatic brain injury (TBI)? Certain groups are at higher risk of TBI: Men are more likely to get a TBI than women. They are also more likely to have serious TBI.  Adults aged 65 and older are at the greatest risk for being hospitalized and dying from a TBI   What are the symptoms of traumatic brain injury (TBI)? The symptoms of TBI depend on the type of injury and how serious the brain damage is.  The symptoms of mild TBI can include: A brief loss of consciousness in some cases. However, many people with mild TBI remain conscious after the injury. Headache Confusion Lightheadedness Dizziness Blurred vision or tired eyes Ringing in the ears Bad taste in the mouth Fatigue or lethargy A change in sleep patterns Behavioral or mood changes Trouble with memory, concentration, attention, or thinking   If you have a moderate or severe TBI, you may have those same symptoms. You may also have other symptoms such as: A headache that gets worse or does not go away Repeated vomiting or nausea Convulsions or seizures Not being able to wake up from sleep Larger than normal pupil (dark center) of one or both eyes. This is called dilation of the pupil. Slurred speech Weakness or numbness in the arms and legs Loss of coordination Increased confusion, restlessness, or agitation   How is traumatic brain injury (TBI) diagnosed? If you have a head injury or other trauma that may have caused a TBI, you need to get medical care as soon as possible. To make a diagnosis, your health care provider: Will ask about your symptoms and the details of your injury Will do a neurologic exam May do imaging tests, such as a CT scan or MRI May use a tool such as the Glasgow coma scale to determine how severe the TBI is. This scale measures your ability to open your eyes, speak, and move. May do neuropsychological tests to check how your brain is functioning   What are the treatments for traumatic brain injury (TBI)? The treatments for TBI depend on many factors, including the size, severity, and location of the brain injury.   For mild TBI, the main treatment is rest. If you have a headache, you can try taking over-the-counter pain relievers. It is important to follow your health care provider's instructions for complete rest and a gradual return to your normal activities. If you start doing too much too soon, it may take longer to recover. Contact your provider if your symptoms are not getting better or if you have new symptoms.  For moderate to severe TBI, the first thing health care providers will do is stabilize you to prevent further injury. They will manage your blood pressure, check the pressure inside your skull, and make sure that there is enough blood and oxygen getting to your brain.  Once you are stable, the treatments may include: Surgery to reduce additional damage to your brain, for example to \t \t\tRemove hematomas (clotted blood) \t\tGet rid of damaged or dead brain tissue \t\tRepair skull fractures \t\tRelieve pressure in the skull \t  Medicines to treat the symptoms of TBI and to lower some of the risks associated with it, such as \t \t\tAnti-anxiety medication to lessen feelings of nervousness and fear \t\tAnticoagulants to prevent blood clots \t\tAnticonvulsants to prevent seizures \t\tAntidepressants to treat symptoms of depression and mood instability \t\tMuscle relaxants to reduce muscle spasms \t\tStimulants to increase alertness and attention \t  Rehabilitation therapies, which can include therapies for physical, emotional, and cognitive difficulties: \t \t\tPhysical therapy, to build physical strength, coordination, and flexibility \t\tOccupational therapy, to help you learn or relearn how to perform daily tasks, such as getting dressed, cooking, and bathing \t\tSpeech therapy, to help you to with speech and other communication skills and treat swallowing disorders \t\tPsychological counseling, to help you learn coping skills, work on relationships, and improve your emotional well-being \t\tVocational counseling, which focuses on your ability to return to work and deal with workplace challenges \t\tCognitive therapy, to improve your memory, attention, perception, learning, planning, and judgment \t   Some people with TBI may have permanent disabilities. A TBI can also put you at risk for other health problems such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder. Treating these problems can improve your quality of life.  Can traumatic brain injury (TBI) be prevented? There are steps you can take to prevent head injuries and TBIs: Always wear your seatbelt and use car seats and booster seats for children Never drive under the influence of drugs or alcohol Wear a properly fitting helmet when riding a bicycle, skateboarding, and playing sports like hockey and football Prevent falls by \t \t\tMaking your house safer. For example, you can install railings on the stairs and grab bars in the tub, get rid of tripping hazards, and use window guards and stair safety gates for young children. \t\tImproving your balance and strength with regular physical activity",

But it can also affect the arms, legs, head, vocal cords, and torso (trunk). A tremor is involuntary, meaning that you cannot control it. It happens because of muscle contractions.  A tremor may come and go, or it may be constant. It can happen on its own or be caused by another disorder. It is not life threatening, but it may cause challenges. It can make it hard to do daily life tasks such as writing, typing, eating, and dressing. In some cases, a tremor can even lead to disabilities.  What are the types of tremor? There are several types of tremor, including: Essential tremor, sometimes called benign essential tremor or familial tremor. This is the most common type. It usually affects both your hands and arms while you are moving them. It can also affect your head, voice, or legs.   Parkinsonian tremor, which is a common symptom in people who have Parkinson's disease. It usually affects one or both hands when they are at rest, but it can affect the chin, lips, face, and legs. Dystonic tremor, which happens in people who have dystonia. Dystonia is a movement disorder in which you have involuntary muscle contractions. The contractions cause you to have twisting and repetitive movements. It can affect any muscle in the body.   What causes tremor? Generally, tremor is caused by a problem in the deep parts of the brain that control movements. For most types, the cause is unknown. Some types are inherited and run in families. There can also be other causes, such as: Neurologic disorders, including multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, stroke, and traumatic brain injury Certain medicines, such as asthma medicines, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, and medicines used for certain psychiatric and neurological disorders Alcohol use disorder (AUD) or alcohol withdrawal Poisoning from certain toxic substances, including pesticides and heavy metals such as mercury and lead Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) Liver or kidney failure Anxiety or panic Too much caffeine   Who is at risk for tremor? Anyone can get tremor, but it is most common in middle-aged and older adults. For certain types of tremor, having a family history raises your risk of getting it.  What are the symptoms of tremor? Symptoms of tremor may include: Rhythmic shaking in the hands, arms, head, legs, or torso Shaky voice Difficulty writing or drawing Problems holding and controlling utensils, such as a spoon   How is tremor diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms  A physical exam, which includes checking: \t\t \t\t\tWhether the tremor happens when the muscles are at rest or in action \t\t\tThe location of the tremor \t\t\tHow often you have the tremor and how strong it is \t\t \t\t A neurological exam, including checking for: \t\t \t\t\tProblems with balance \t\t\tProblems with speech \t\t\tIncreased muscle stiffness \t\t \t\t Blood or urine tests to look for the cause Imaging tests to help figure out if the cause is damage to your brain Tests that check your abilities to do daily tasks such as handwriting and holding a fork or cup An electromyogram, a test that measures involuntary muscle activity and how your muscles respond to nerve stimulation   What are the treatments for tremor? There is no cure for most forms of tremor, but there are treatments to help manage symptoms. In some cases, the symptoms may be so mild that you do not need treatment.  Finding the right treatment depends on getting the right diagnosis of the cause. Tremor caused by another medical condition may get better or go away when you treat that condition. If your tremor is caused by a certain medicine, stopping that medicine usually makes the tremor go away.  Treatments for tremor can include: Medicines. There are different medicines for the specific types of tremor. Another option is Botox injections, which can treat several different types of tremor. Surgery may be used for severe cases that do not get better with medicines. The most common type is deep brain stimulation (DBS). DBS uses electrodes that are implanted in the brain. The electrodes send electrical pulses to the parts of the brain that are causing the tremor. Physical, speech-language, and occupational therapy, which may help to control tremor and deal with the daily challenges caused by the tremor.   If you find that caffeine and other stimulants trigger your tremors, it may be helpful to cut them from your diet.   NIH: National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke",

But it can also attack other parts of the body, including the kidneys, spine, and brain.   Not everyone infected with TB bacteria (germs) becomes sick. So, there are two types of TB conditions:  Inactive (latent) TB infection, where the TB germs live in your body but don't make you sick.  TB disease (active TB) where you get sick from the TB germs. TB disease can almost always be cured with antibiotics. But if it's not treated properly, it can be fatal.   TB is found in the U.S., but it is more common in certain other countries.  What causes tuberculosis (TB)? TB is caused by bacteria (germs) called Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The germs spread from person to person through the air. People who have TB disease in their throat or lungs spread the germs in the air when they cough, sneeze, talk, or sing. If you breathe in the air that has the germs, you can get TB.  TB is not spread by touching, kissing, or sharing food or dishes.  You're more likely to catch TB from people you live or work with than from people you see for shorter amounts of time.  Who is more likely to get infected with tuberculosis (TB) germs? Anyone who is near a person with TB disease can get infected with the germs. You are more likely to be near someone with TB disease if you:  Were born in or often travel to countries where TB disease is common Are a health care worker Work or live in a place where TB is more common, such as shelters for people without homes, jails, and nursing homes   Who is more likely to develop TB disease? Certain people are more likely to get sick with TB disease after they get infected. They include people who:  Have HIV Became infected with TB in the last 2 years Have other diseases, such as diabetes, that make it hard for your body to fight TB germs Have alcohol use disorder (AUD) or inject illegal drugs  Were not treated correctly for TB in the past Are under age 5 Are an older adult Take medicines that weaken the immune system, such as medicines taken after an organ transplant, steroids, and specialized treatments for certain autoimmune diseases    What are the symptoms of tuberculosis (TB)? Most people who have TB germs in their bodies don't get sick with TB disease. Instead, they have inactive TB infection. With an inactive TB infection, you:  Don't have symptoms Can't spread TB to others Could get sick with active TB disease in the future if your immune system becomes weak for another reason Need to take medicine to prevent getting sick with active TB disease in the future   If you have TB disease, the TB germs are active, meaning that they are growing (multiplying) inside your body and making you sick. If the TB is growing in your lungs or throat, you can spread the TB germs to other people. You can get sick with TB disease weeks to years after you're infected with TB germs.  With TB disease, your symptoms will depend on where the TB is growing in your body:  General symptoms may include:  \t \t\tChills and fever \t\tNight sweats (heavy sweating during sleep) \t\tLosing weight without trying \t\tLoss of appetite \t\tWeakness or fatigue \t  Symptoms from TB disease in your lungs may include: \t \t\tA cough that lasts longer than 3 weeks \t\tCoughing up blood or sputum (a thick mucus from the lungs) \t\tChest pain \t    How is tuberculosis (TB) diagnosed? Your health care provider or your local health department can test you to find out if you have TB germs in your body. They will give you either a TB skin or blood test.   If your test shows that you have TB germs, you'll need to have other tests to see if the germs are actively growing:  Tests for TB disease in the lungs usually include testing samples of your sputum and having chest x-rays.  Tests for TB disease in other parts of your body may include tests of urine and tissue samples.    You may need a TB test if you have symptoms of TB disease or if you are at high risk because you are more likely to be near someone with TB disease.   People who have HIV also need to get tested for TB. HIV weakens your immune system. So if you have both HIV and inactive TB, the TB can quickly become active TB disease. You will need treatment for the inactive TB as soon as possible to prevent active TB disease.  What is the treatment for tuberculosis (TB)?  The treatment for both inactive TB infection and TB disease is antibiotics. To make sure you get rid of all the TB germs in your body, it's very important to follow the directions for taking your medicine.  If you don't follow the directions, the TB germs in your body could change and become antibiotic resistant. That means the medicine may stop working and your TB may become hard to cure.    For inactive TB infections, you need to take medicines for three, four, six, or nine months, depending on the treatment plan. Treatment helps make sure you don't get TB disease in the future.  For active TB disease, you usually need to take medicines for four, six, or nine months, depending on the treatment plan. Treatment will almost always cure you if you take your pills the right way.  For TB disease in your lungs or throat, you'll need to stay home for a few weeks, so you don't spread disease to other people. You can protect the people you live with by:  \t \t\tCovering your nose and mouth. \t\tOpening windows when possible. \t\tNot getting too close to them. \t  For drug-resistant TB disease, which means that the TB germs are resistant to certain TB medicines, you will need to take special medicines. Treatment may take a long time, sometimes months or years. The medicines can cause side effects. Your provider will closely monitor your treatment to make sure the medicines are working.   By following medical advice for TB testing and treatment, you can keep yourself healthy and help stop the spread of TB.  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

    "summary": "What is Turner syndrome? Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects a girl's development and appearance. It can also cause health problems such as infertility and heart problems.  What causes Turner syndrome? Turner syndrome happens because of a problem with a chromosome. Chromosomes are tiny \"packages\" in your cells that contain your genes. Genes carry information, called DNA, that controls what you look like and how your body works.  Normally, girls receive one X chromosome from each parent. Turner syndrome happens when one of the X chromosomes is partially or completely missing.  What are the symptoms of Turner syndrome? Turner syndrome can cause many different symptoms. The symptoms may be mild for some people. But for others, Turner syndrome can cause serious health problems.  Some of the symptoms of Turner syndrome affect a person's appearance. Most people with Turner syndrome are shorter than average. They may also have physical features such as:  A neck that is short and has extra skin (a \"webbed\" neck) A low hairline in the back Low-set ears Swollen hands and feet   People with Turner syndrome may be born with heart and kidney defects. They usually don't have typical sexual development and are infertile. They are also at risk for other health problems such as high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, osteoporosis, and thyroid problems.  How is Turner syndrome diagnosed? Health care providers diagnose Turner syndrome based on symptoms and a genetic blood test called a karyotype test. Sometimes it is found in prenatal testing.  What are the treatments for Turner syndrome? There is no cure for Turner syndrome, but there are treatments for some of the symptoms:  If they are started in early childhood, hormone injections can often increase adult height by a few inches Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) can help start sexual development. It also protects against bone loss Assisted reproduction technologies can help some women with Turner syndrome get pregnant   People who have Turner syndrome need regular health checks. It's also important for them to have a care team that includes specialists who can treat the health problems caused by Turner syndrome.

They can be important tools in helping you manage your health. But it's not always easy to understand them and know what they mean for your life. For example:  What you hear about a study may not explain how it fits into the bigger picture. Sometimes the results of one study seem to disagree with the results of another study. That could be because the studies could have different designs and asked different questions. The news stories don't always explain this. Sometimes the studies are very small, and researchers need to do more studies to confirm the results. But the news stories about these small studies may not highlight this.    So it's important to think carefully when reading or listening to reports of new medical findings. Here are some questions that can help you evaluate that information:  Was the study in animals or humans? Getting certain results in animals may not mean that you get those same results in humans. Were the people in the study similar to you in ways that may matter, such as age, race, or sex? How big was the study? Larger studies may get more reliable results than smaller studies. How long did the study last? For example, studies testing medicines need to be long enough to show long-term benefits or risks. What kind of study was it?  Clinical trials, especially randomized controlled trials, give the clearest information about whether a treatment is effective and safe in humans. In randomized controlled trials, the people in the study are randomly divided into separate groups that get different treatments. This helps prevent bias in the results. Where was the research done? If a new treatment was being tested, what were the side effects? How common were they? How do the results from the study compare with previous studies? If the new study had different results, then more studies would be needed to confirm these results. Who paid for the research? Sometimes the people paying for the research could profit financially if the study gets certain results. Who is reporting the results? Do they have a certain bias?   It can be helpful to stay informed about new medical findings. But it's good to have some skepticism. Keep these questions in mind the next time you hear about a big new medical breakthrough.",

    "summary": "What is urinary incontinence (UI)?  Urinary incontinence (UI) is the loss of bladder control, or being unable to control urination. It is a common condition. It can range from being a minor problem to something that greatly affects your daily life.  In any case, it can get better with proper treatment.   What are the types of urinary incontinence (UI)?  There are several different types of UI. Each type has different symptoms and causes: Stress incontinence happens when stress or pressure on your bladder causes you to leak urine.  This could be due to coughing, sneezing, laughing, lifting something heavy, or physical activity. Causes include weak pelvic floor muscles and the bladder being out of its normal position.  Urge, or urgency, incontinence happens when you have a strong urge (need) to urinate, and some urine leaks out before you can make it to the toilet. It is often related to an overactive bladder. Urge incontinence is most common in older people. It can sometimes be a sign of a urinary tract infection (UTI). It can also happen in some neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injuries.  Overflow incontinence happens when your bladder doesn't empty all the way. This causes too much urine to stay in your bladder. Your bladder gets too full, and you leak urine. This form of UI is most common in men. Some of the causes include tumors, kidney stones, diabetes, and certain medicines.  Functional incontinence happens when a physical or mental disability, trouble speaking, or some other problem keeps you from getting to the toilet in time. For example, someone with arthritis may have trouble unbuttoning his or her pants, or a person with Alzheimer's disease may not realize they need to plan to use the toilet. Mixed incontinence means that you have more than one type of incontinence. It's usually a combination of stress and urge incontinence. Transient incontinence is urine leakage that is caused by a temporary (transient) situation such as an infection or new medicine. Once the cause is removed, the incontinence goes away. Bedwetting refers to urine leakage during sleep. This is most common in children, but adults can also have it.             Bedwetting is normal for many children. It is more common in boys. Bedwetting is often not considered a health problem, especially when it runs in the family. But if it still happens often at age 5 and older, it may be because of a bladder control problem. This problem could be caused by slow physical development, an illness, making too much urine at night, or another problem. Sometimes there is more than one cause.          In adults, the causes include some medicines, caffeine, and alcohol. It can also be caused by certain health problems, such as diabetes insipidus, a urinary tract infection (UTI), kidney stones, enlarged prostate (BPH), and sleep apnea.            Who is at risk for urinary incontinence (UI)? In adults, you are at higher risk of developing UI if you: Are female, especially after going through pregnancy, childbirth, and/or menopause Are older. As you age, your urinary tract muscles weaken, making it harder to hold in urine. Are a man with prostate problems Have certain health problems, such as diabetes, obesity, or long-lasting constipation Are a smoker Have a birth defect that affects the structure of your urinary tract  In children, bedwetting is more common in younger children, boys, and those whose parents wet the bed when they were children.  How is urinary incontinence (UI) diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to make a diagnosis: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms. Your provider may ask you to keep a bladder diary for a few days before your appointment. The bladder diary includes how much and when you drink liquids, when and how much you urinate, and whether you leak urine. A physical exam, which can include a rectal exam. Women may also get a pelvic exam. Urine and/or blood tests Bladder function tests Imaging tests   What are the treatments for urinary incontinence (UI)? Treatment depends on the type and cause of your UI. You may need a combination of treatments. Your provider may first suggest self-care treatments, including: Lifestyle changes to reduce leaks:                      Drinking the right amount of liquid at the right time             Being physically active             Staying at a healthy weigh             Avoiding constipation             Not smoking               Bladder training. This involves urinating according to a schedule. Your provider makes a schedule from you, based on information from your bladder diary. After you adjust to the schedule, you gradually wait a little longer between trips to the bathroom. This can help stretch your bladder so it can hold more urine. Doing exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles. Strong pelvic floor muscles hold in urine better than weak muscles. The strengthening exercises are called Kegel exercises. They involve tightening and relaxing the muscles that control urine flow.  If these treatments do not work, your provider may suggest other options such as: Medicines, which can be used to                      Relax the bladder muscles, to help prevent bladder spasms             Block nerve signals that cause urinary frequency and urgency             In men, shrink the prostate and improve urine flow                          Medical devices, including                      A catheter, which is a tube to carry urine out of the body. You might use one a few times a day or all the time.             For women, a ring or a tampon-like device inserted into the vagina. The devices pushes up against your urethra to help decrease leaks.           Bulking agents, which are injected into the bladder neck and urethra tissues to thicken them. This helps close your bladder opening so you have less leaking. Electrical nerve stimulation, which involves changing your bladder's reflexes using pulses of electricity Surgery to support the bladder in its normal position. This may be done with a sling that is attached to the pubic bone.   NIH: National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases",

The uterus is the place where a fetus grows during pregnancy.   There are two types of uterine cancer:  Endometrial cancer is the most common type. This type of cancer begins in the cells lining the uterus, known as the endometrium.  Uterine sarcoma is a rare, more aggressive cancer that is harder to treat. This type of cancer begins in muscle or other tissues in the uterus.   Who is more likely to develop uterine cancer? Uterine cancer usually happens after menopause. The cause is unknown. However, some factors and conditions that change the balance of hormones in your body may increase your risk. These can include obesity or metabolic syndrome (a group of risk factors for certain health problems).  Other factors and conditions that may increase your risk for:  Endometrial cancer   Taking estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy (HRT) after menopause.  Having type 2 diabetes.  Starting menstruation at an early age or menopause at a later age. Having never been pregnant. Taking tamoxifen, a medicine used to prevent or treat breast cancer.  Having polycystic ovary syndrome. Having a mother, sister, or daughter who has had endometrial cancer. Having certain genetic conditions, such as Lynch syndrome. Having endometrial hyperplasia (thickening of the uterine lining).   Uterine sarcoma  Having had past treatment with radiation therapy to the pelvis. Taking tamoxifen, a medicine used to prevent or treat breast cancer.    What are the symptoms of uterine cancer? The most common symptom of both endometrial cancer and uterine sarcoma is abnormal vaginal bleeding. Both types of uterine cancer may also cause pelvic pain or pressure, unusual vaginal discharge, or an enlarged uterus or pelvic mass.  Less common symptoms may include urinating (peeing) often, having trouble urinating, or pain during sexual intercourse.   How is uterine cancer diagnosed? If you have symptoms of uterine cancer, your health care provider may:  Ask about your medical history and family health history. Do a pelvic exam. Order imaging tests. Suggest a biopsy or a minor procedure called dilation and curettage (D &amp; C) to check the lining of your uterus.    What are the treatments for uterine cancer? Treatment may depend on your health, how much cancer you have, and whether it has spread. The most common treatment is having a hysterectomy, which is surgery to remove the uterus. Sometimes the surgery also removes the ovaries and fallopian tubes.   You may have more than one type of treatment. Other treatments may include:  Hormone therapy Radiation therapy Chemotherapy    Can uterine cancer be prevented? There is no sure way to prevent uterine cancer. But you can do things that may help lower your risk such as aiming for a healthy weight, getting regular physical activity, and talking to your provider about the benefits and risks of hormone therapy.

    "summary": "What are uterine fibroids? Uterine fibroids are the most common noncancerous (benign) tumors in women of childbearing age. You may have uterine fibroids and not even know it since they often don't cause any symptoms. Fibroids are made of muscle cells and other tissues that grow in and around the wall of the uterus, or womb. They can vary in number and size and grow as one tumor or in clusters.  Many women with fibroids can get pregnant with no problems. However, some uterine fibroids could cause infertility (not being able to get pregnant), pregnancy loss, or problems with fetal development or delivery.  Who is more likely to get uterine fibroids? If you're a female and the age when you're usually able to get pregnant and give birth, you could develop fibroids. Some factors may increase your risk of having uterine fibroids. These can include:  Age. Women who are older have a higher risk. Race/ethnicity. Black/African American women often have fibroids at a younger age. They're also more likely to have larger fibroids with worse symptoms. Family history. If your mother or sister had uterine fibroids. Other factors. If you started your period before age 10 or have never been pregnant.  Certain medical conditions. These include obesity or vitamin D deficiency.   Your risk of getting uterine fibroids lowers with each pregnancy and with long-term use of birth control pills or shots.   What causes uterine fibroids? No one knows what causes uterine fibroids. A few things that might play a part in getting uterine fibroids include genetics and growth hormones. Also, other hormones like estrogen and progesterone seem to help fibroids grow. These hormones cause the tissue lining inside the uterus to thicken during each menstrual cycle to prepare for pregnancy.  What are the symptoms of uterine fibroids? Many women with fibroids have no symptoms. If you do, the type of symptoms may be due to location, size, and number of fibroids. Symptoms may include:   Heavy or painful periods or bleeding between periods Feeling \"full\" in the lower abdomen (belly) Urinating (peeing) often Pain during sex Lower back pain Problems getting pregnant, multiple miscarriages, or early labor while pregnant   How are uterine fibroids diagnosed? You may not know that you have uterine fibroids unless you have symptoms. Or your health care provider may find the fibroids during a pelvic exam, or with imaging tests.   Uterine fibroids might be very small, or in extreme cases, they may grow large enough to make it appear like a pregnancy.  What are the treatments for uterine fibroids? If you have no symptoms, you may not even need treatment. If you have symptoms, the treatment for uterine fibroids depends on many factors. These can include:  Your symptoms. Your age. Sometimes fibroids shrink during and after menopause due to a drop in hormone levels. The location, type, and size of fibroids. If you are pregnant or want to get pregnant in the future.   Treatment may include medicines that can slow or stop fibroid growth. Surgery, such as a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus), may be considered if you are near or past menopause, your fibroids are very large or cause heavy bleeding.  If you are having trouble getting pregnant, your provider may discuss infertility treatments. They may also recommend an emotional support group if you have chronic symptoms or difficulties getting pregnant or maintaining a pregnancy.

    "disease": "Vaccine Safety",
    "summary": "What are vaccines? Vaccines play an important role in keeping us healthy. They protect us from serious and sometimes deadly diseases. Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. The germs could be viruses or bacteria.  Some types of vaccines contain germs that cause disease. But the germs have been killed or weakened enough that they won't make you sick. Some vaccines only contain a part of a germ. Other types of vaccines include instructions for your cells to make a protein of the germ.  These different vaccine types all spark an immune response, which helps your body fight off the germs. Your immune system will also remember the germ and attack it if that germ ever invades again. This protection against a certain disease is called immunity.  These diseases can be very serious. Because of this, getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease. And for a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would.  Do vaccines cause side effects? As with medicines, any vaccine can cause side effects. Most of the time the side effects are minor, such as a sore arm, fatigue, or mild fever. They usually go away within a few days. These common side effects are often a sign that your body is starting to build immunity against a disease. Serious side effects from vaccines can happen, but they are very rare. These side effects could include a severe allergic reaction. Other possible side effects are different for each vaccine. Talk with your health care provider if you're concerned about your health after getting vaccinated. Some people worry that childhood vaccines could cause autism spectrum disorder (ASD). But many scientific studies have looked at this and have found no link between vaccines and ASD.   How are vaccines tested for safety? Every vaccine that is approved in the United States goes through extensive safety testing. It starts with testing and evaluation of the vaccine before it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This process can often take several years.: First, the vaccine is tested in labs. Based on those tests, the FDA decides whether to test the vaccine with people. Testing with people is done through clinical trials. In these trials, the vaccines are tested on volunteers. Clinical trials usually start with 20 to 100 volunteers, but eventually include thousands of volunteers. The clinical trials have three phases. The trials are looking for the answer to important questions such as  \t \t\tIs the vaccine safe? \t\tWhat dose (amount) works best? \t\tHow does the immune system react to it? \t\tHow effective is it? \t  During the process, the FDA works closely with the company who makes the vaccine to evaluate the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. If the vaccine is found to be safe and effective, it will be approved and licensed by the FDA.   After a vaccine is licensed, experts may consider adding it to the recommended vaccine, or immunization, schedule. This schedule is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. They list which age groups should get which vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them.  Testing and monitoring continue after the vaccine is approved: The company making the vaccines tests every batch of vaccines for quality and safety. The FDA reviews the results of these tests. It also inspects the factories where the vaccine is made. These checks help make sure the vaccines meet standards for quality and safety. The FDA, CDC, and other federal agencies continue to monitor its safety, to watch for possible side effects. They have systems to track any safety issues with the vaccines.  These high safety standards and testing help to make sure that vaccines in the United States are safe. Vaccines help protect against serious, even deadly, diseases. They not only protect you, but also help to keep these diseases from spreading to others.",

    "summary": "What are vaccines? Vaccines are injections (shots), liquids, pills, or nasal sprays that you take to teach your body's immune system to recognize and defend against harmful germs. For example, there are vaccines to protect against diseases caused by: Viruses, like the ones that cause the flu and COVID-19 Bacteria, including tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis   What are the types of vaccines? There are several types of vaccines: Live-attenuated vaccines use a weakened form of the germ. Inactivated vaccines use a killed version of the germ. Subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines use only specific pieces of the germ, such as its protein, sugar, or casing. Toxoid vaccines use a toxin (harmful product) made by the germ. mRNA vaccines use messenger RNA, which gives your cells instructions for how to make a protein (or piece of a protein) of the germ. Viral vector vaccines use genetic material, which gives your cells instructions for making a protein of the germ. These vaccines also contain a different, harmless virus that helps get the genetic material into your cells.   These vaccines may work in different ways, but they all spark an immune response. The immune response is the way your body defends itself against substances it sees as foreign or harmful. These substances include germs that can cause disease.   What happens in an immune response? There are different steps in the immune response: When a germ invades, your body sees it as foreign. Your immune system helps your body fight off the germ. Your immune system also remembers the germ. It will attack the germ if it ever invades again. This \"memory\" protects you against the disease that the germ causes. This type of protection is called immunity.   What are immunization and vaccination? Immunization is the process of becoming protected against a disease. But it can also mean the same thing as vaccination, which is getting a vaccine to become protected against a disease.  Why are vaccines important? Vaccines are important because they protect you against many diseases. These diseases can be very serious. So getting immunity from a vaccine is safer than getting immunity by being sick with the disease.   For a few vaccines, getting vaccinated can actually give you a better immune response than getting the disease would.  But vaccines don't just protect you. They also protect the people around you through community immunity.  What is community immunity? Community immunity, or herd immunity, is the idea that vaccines can help keep communities healthy.  Normally, germs can travel quickly through a community and make a lot of people sick. If enough people get sick, it can lead to an outbreak. But when enough people are vaccinated against a certain disease, it's harder for that disease to spread to others. This type of protection means that the entire community is less likely to get the disease.   Community immunity is especially important for people who can't get certain vaccines. For example, they may not be able to get a vaccine because they have weakened immune systems. Others may be allergic to certain vaccine ingredients. And newborn babies are too young to get some vaccines. Community immunity can help to protect them all.  Are vaccines safe? Vaccines are safe. They must go through extensive safety testing and evaluation before they are approved in the United States.  What is a vaccine schedule? A vaccine, or immunization, schedule lists which vaccines are recommended for different groups of people. It includes who should get the vaccines, how many doses they need, and when they should get them. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) publishes the vaccine schedule.   It's important for both children and adults to get their vaccines according to the schedule. Following the schedule allows them to get protection from the diseases at exactly the right time.",

The vagina is the canal leading from your cervix (the opening of your uterus) to the outside of your body.   Who is more likely to develop vaginal cancer? You are more likely to develop vaginal cancer if:  You're age 60 or older. You've had certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) infections. You were exposed to a medicine called DES (diethylstilbestrol) before you were born. Between 1940-1971, DES was sometimes prescribed to prevent miscarriages. DES was later linked to different health problems, including vaginal cancer. You have had abnormal cells in your vagina, cervix, or uterus.   What are the symptoms of vaginal cancer?

    "summary": "What is vaginitis?  Vaginitis, also called vulvovaginitis, is an inflammation or infection of the vagina. It can also affect the vulva, which is the external part of a woman's genitals. Vaginitis can cause itching, pain, discharge, and odor.    Vaginitis is common, especially in women in their reproductive years.  It usually happens when there is a change in the balance of bacteria or yeast that are normally found in your vagina. There are different types of vaginitis, and they have different causes, symptoms, and treatments.  What  causes vaginitis?  Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women ages 15-44. It happens when there is an imbalance between the \"good\" and \"harmful\" bacteria that are normally found in a woman's vagina. Many things can change the balance of bacteria, including: Taking antibiotics Douching Using an intrauterine device (IUD) Having unprotected sex with a new partner Having many sexual partners   Yeast infections (candidiasis) happen when too much candida grows in the vagina. Candida is the scientific name for yeast. It is a fungus that lives almost everywhere, including in your body. You may have too much growing in the vagina because of: Antibiotics Pregnancy Diabetes, especially if it is not well-controlled Corticosteroid medicines   Trichomoniasis can also cause vaginitis. Trichomoniasis is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI). It is caused by a parasite.  You can also have vaginitis if you are allergic or sensitive to certain products that you use. Examples include vaginal sprays, douches, spermicides, soaps, detergents, or fabric softeners. They can cause burning, itching, and discharge.  Hormonal changes can also cause vaginal irritation. Examples are when you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or when you have gone through menopause.  Sometimes you can have more than one cause of vaginitis at the same time.  What are the symptoms of vaginitis?  The symptoms of vaginitis depend on which type you have.  With BV, you may not have symptoms. You could have a thin white or gray vaginal discharge. There may be an odor, such as a strong fish-like odor, especially after sex.  Yeast infections produce a thick, white discharge from the vagina that can look like cottage cheese. The discharge can be watery and often has no smell. Yeast infections usually cause the vagina and vulva to become itchy and red.  You may not have symptoms when you have trichomoniasis. If you do have them, they include itching, burning, and soreness of the vagina and vulva. You may have burning during urination. You could also have gray-green discharge, which may smell bad.  How is the cause of vaginitis diagnosed?  To find out the cause of your symptoms, your health care provider may: Ask you about your medical history Do a pelvic exam Look for vaginal discharge, noting its color, qualities, and any odor Study a sample of your vaginal fluid under a microscope   In some cases, you may need more tests.  What are the treatments for vaginitis?  The treatment depends on which type of vaginitis you have.  BV is treatable with antibiotics. You may get pills to swallow, or cream or gel that you put in your vagina. During treatment, you should use a condom during sex or not have sex at all.  Yeast infections are usually treated with a cream or with medicine that you put inside your vagina. You can buy over-the-counter treatments for yeast infections, but you need to be sure that you do have a yeast infection and not another type of vaginitis. See your health care provider if this is the first time you have had symptoms. Even if you have had yeast infections before, it is a good idea to call your health care provider before using an over-the-counter treatment.  The treatment for trichomoniasis is usually a single-dose antibiotic. Both you and your partner(s) should be treated, to prevent spreading the infection to others and to keep from getting it again.  If your vaginitis is due to an allergy or sensitivity to a product, you need to figure out which product is causing the problem. It could be a product that you started using recently. Once you figure it out, you should stop using the product.  If the cause of your vaginitis is a hormonal change, your health care provider may give you estrogen cream to help with your symptoms.  Can vaginitis cause other health problems?  It is important to treat BV and trichomoniasis, because having either of them can increase your risk for getting HIV or another STI. If you are pregnant, BV or trichomoniasis can increase your risk for preterm labor and preterm birth.  Can vaginitis be prevented?  To help prevent vaginitis: Do not douche or use vaginal sprays. Use a latex condom when having sex. If your or your partner is allergic to latex, you can use polyurethane condoms. Avoid clothes that hold in heat and moisture. Wear cotton underwear.",

    "disease": "Vasectomy",
    "summary": "A vasectomy is a type of minor surgery that prevents a man from being able to get a woman pregnant. It is a permanent form of birth control.  A vasectomy works by cutting the vas deferens, which are the tubes that carry the sperm out of the testicles. Then the sperm can no longer reach the semen. Semen is the fluid that the penis ejaculates (releases during orgasm). Since there are no sperm, the man cannot get a woman pregnant.  The surgery is quick; it usually takes less than 30 minutes. You will probably be able to go home the same day. You may have some discomfort, bruising, and swelling for a few days. In most cases, you will fully recover in less than a week.  A vasectomy is one of the most effective forms of birth control. But it takes about three months (or about 20 ejaculations) before it is effective. You will still need to use other birth control until you know that your semen doesn't have any more sperm in it. After two to three months, your health care provider will test your semen to make sure that there are no sperm in it.   Having a vasectomy does not affect your sex life. It does not decrease your sex drive. And it will not affect your ability to get an erection or have an orgasm.  Vasectomies can sometimes be reversed, but not always. It is done with a procedure to reconnect the vas deferens. Another option if you decide to have children later might be to have sperm taken from your testicles. The sperm could then be used for in vitro fertilization (IVF). However, this may not always work. It's also important to know that both a vasectomy reversal and IVF are expensive.  Having a vasectomy does not protect you from sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as HIV.

Sometimes the injuries are life-threatening or serious enough to cause disability. Others may not be as serious, but they may be painful and can affect daily life.   Some of the specific types of injuries that service members may face include:   Sprains and strains, especially in the ankles and knees. These injuries are often caused by exercise and running. Back and shoulder injuries, often from lifting and carrying. Tinnitus and hearing loss, typically from exposure to noise. Head injuries and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs). Shrapnel and gunshot wounds. Lost limbs.   What other special health problems do service members face? There may also be a risk of health problems from exposure to environmental hazards, such as contaminated water, chemicals, infections, and burn pits. Sometimes the health problems caused by exposures don't develop until years later.  Some service members experience military sexual trauma (MST). This includes sexual assault and sexual harassment.  What mental health issues do service members and veterans face? Being in combat and being separated from your family can be stressful. So can readjusting to civilian life after the military. All of this stress can put service members and veterans at risk for mental health problems, including:   Depression Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) Anxiety Alcohol and drug use disorders   There is also a risk of suicide. Veterans who are in crisis can get help from the Veteran's Crisis line by:  Calling 988 and then pressing 1 Texting to 838255 Chatting with them online   What health care services are available to service members and veterans? There are health care services especially for service members and veterans through:  TRICARE, which is the Department of Defense's health care program. It has insurance plans and other services for uniformed service members, retirees, and their families around the world. The Veterans Health Administration, which is part of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). It provides medical and social support services to eligible veterans. The VA 's expanded health care and benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits, Agent Orange, and other toxic substances.   To better understand and treat the health needs of veterans in the future, the VA created the Million Veteran Program (MVP). This research program is looking at how genes, lifestyle, military experiences, and exposures affect health and wellness in veterans.",

    "disease": "Viral Infections",
    "summary": "What are viruses? Viruses are very tiny germs. They are made of genetic material (either DNA  or RNA) inside of a protein coating. There are a huge number of viruses on earth. Only a small number of them can infect humans. Those viruses can infect our cells, which may cause disease. Some of the diseases that viruses can cause include the common cold, the flu, COVID-19, and HIV.   How are viruses spread? Viruses can be spread in different ways:  Through droplets and particles that are breathed out by someone who has the infection. You might breathe in the droplets or particles, or they could land on your mouth, nose, or eyes. By touching surfaces or objects that have the virus on them and then touching your mouth, nose, or eyes. From the pregnant parent to the baby during pregnancy. Through contaminated food or water. By being bitten by an infected insect or animal.  Through sexual contact (usually vaginal, anal and oral sex) with someone who has the infection.     How do viruses cause disease? Viruses are like hijackers. They invade living, normal cells. They then use those cells to multiply (make copies of themselves). This process is also called replication. The process can kill, damage, or change the infected cells. Sometimes this can make you sick. The symptoms can range from mild to very severe. Other times, your immune system may be able to fight it off and you may not have any symptoms.  Each different virus usually only infects one type of cell in your body. For example, hepatitis viruses affect the cells in the liver. HIV infects a certain type of immune system cell.     What are the treatments for viral infections? For most viral infections, treatments can only help with symptoms while you wait for your immune system to fight off the virus. There are antiviral medicines to treat some viral infections. Antibiotics do not work for viral infections.  Can viral infections be prevented? Vaccines can help prevent you from getting many viral diseases. You may be able to prevent some viral infections by:  Proper hand washing. Paying attention to food safety. Cleaning surfaces that may be infected with germs. Avoiding contact with wild animals. Preventing insect bites by using insect repellent when you go outdoors. If you travel to an area that has a high risk of diseases from insect bites, also wear long pants, shirts, and socks. Practicing safe sex (using a condom every time you have anal, vaginal, or oral sex). Avoiding close contact with people who are sick.",

    "disease": "Vision Impairment and Blindness",
    "summary": "What is vision impairment? Vision impairment is the loss of vision. It includes blindness, which means that you have lost all or most of your sight. It also includes low vision, which means you have some vision, but the vision loss makes it hard to do everyday activities. You may have trouble reading, shopping, cooking, writing, and watching TV. Low vision can't be fixed with glasses, contact lenses, medicine, or surgery.   What causes vision impairment? Aging doesn't cause vision loss on its own. But many diseases that are more common in older adults can cause it. The leading causes of low vision and blindness in the United States are age-related eye diseases such as macular degeneration, cataracts, and glaucoma. Other eye disorders, eye injuries, and birth defects can also cause vision loss.   How is vision impairment diagnosed? Vision impairment is diagnosed with a dilated eye exam. Early warning signs of a vision problem can include not being able to see well enough to:   Do everyday tasks like reading and driving  Recognize people's faces   Tell the difference between colors  See the television or computer screen clearly    You can have these symptoms even though you are wearing glasses or contacts.  What are the types of low vision? There are several types of low vision. Which type you have depends on the condition that caused your low vision.  Common types of low vision include:  Central vision loss (not being able to see things in the center of your vision) Peripheral (side) vision loss (not being able to see things out of the corners of your eyes) Night blindness (not being able to see in low light) Blurry or hazy vision   What are the treatments for low vision? Low vision is permanent. Glasses, medicine, and surgery can't cure low vision. But sometimes they can improve your vision, help you do everyday activities more easily, or keep your remaining vision. Your treatment options will depend on the condition that caused your low vision. Ask your eye doctor which treatments might help you.  They may recommend vision aids or vision rehabilitation, which might make everyday activities easier. Vision rehabilitation teaches you how to live with your vision loss. It may include:  Showing you how to use a magnifying device or screen readers for reading Helping you set up your home so you can move around more easily Employment and job training  Assistive devices, like lighting and reading stands   Your provider may suggest other resources, such as transportation and household services, to help you cope with your vision loss.  How can I make the most of my remaining sight? The sooner vision loss or eye disease is found and treated, the greater your chances of keeping your remaining vision. Whatever the cause, lost vision cannot be restored. But it can be managed. A loss of vision means you may have to reorganize your life and learn new ways of doing things. Your provider may make suggestions to help make life easier. These may include: If you have some vision:  Visual aids such as magnifiers Telescopic glasses or monoculars for seeing distance Large print books  Clocks with larger numbers Brighter lights Anti-glare sunglasses or glare shields   If you have no vision (blindness):   Devices like text-reading software and braille books   Can vision impairment be prevented? You can help take care of your vision by:  Having regular comprehensive eye exams by an eye care professional Wearing sunglasses and protective eyewear to protect your eyes Making lifestyle changes to lower your risk of health conditions that can cause vision problems:  \t \t\tGetting regular physical activity \t\tStaying at a healthy weight \t\tQuitting smoking (or not starting) \t\tEating a healthy diet \t    NIH: National Eye Institute",

    "summary": "Why do I need vitamin D? Vitamins are substances that your body needs to grow and develop normally. Vitamin D is important to your body because:  It helps your body absorb calcium. Calcium is one of the main building blocks of bone. A lack of vitamin D can lead to bone diseases such as osteoporosis or rickets. It also has a role in your nerve, muscle, and immune systems:      Your muscles need it to move   Your nerves need it to carry messages between your brain and your body   Your immune system needs vitamin D to fight off bacteria and viruses       How do I get vitamin D? You can get vitamin D in three ways: through your skin, from your diet, and from supplements. Your body forms vitamin D naturally after exposure to sunlight. However, too much sun exposure can lead to skin aging and skin cancer. So many people try to get their vitamin D from other sources.  Very few foods naturally contain vitamin D. Most people get vitamin D in their diet from foods that are fortified. This means that vitamin D is added to the food. These foods may include milk, cereal, and yogurt. Foods that naturally have vitamin D include egg yolks, saltwater fish, and liver.   Vitamin D is available in supplements. It is also included in many multivitamins. The two forms of vitamin D in supplements are D2 and D3. Both types increase vitamin D in your blood, but D3 might raise it higher and for longer than D2. Vitamin D is fat soluble. You can absorb it better when you take your supplements with a meal or snack that includes some fat.  How much vitamin D do I need? The amount of vitamin D you need each day depends on your age. The recommended amounts, in international units (IU), are: Birth to 12 months: 400 IU Children 1-13 years: 600 IU Teens 14-18 years: 600 IU Adults 19-70 years: 600 IU Adults 71 years and older: 800 IU If you are pregnant or breastfeeding: 600 IU   But certain people may need extra vitamin D, such as:  Older adults Breastfed infants People with dark skin People with  certain conditions that limit the absorption of fat, such as Crohn's disease, celiac disease, and ulcerative colitis People who have obesity or have had gastric bypass surgery   Check with your health care provider to see if you need to take vitamin D supplements, and if so, how much you should take.

Check with your health care provider about how much you need.  What causes vitamin D deficiency? You can become deficient in vitamin D for different reasons: You don't get enough vitamin D in your diet You don't absorb enough vitamin D from food (a malabsorption problem) You don't get enough exposure to sunlight Your liver or kidneys cannot convert vitamin D to its active form in the body You take medicines that interfere with your body's ability to convert or absorb vitamin D   Who is at risk of vitamin D deficiency? Some people are at higher risk of vitamin D deficiency: Breastfed infants, because human milk is a poor source of vitamin D. If you are breastfeeding, give your infant a supplement of 400 IU of vitamin D every day. Older adults, because your skin doesn't make vitamin D when exposed to sunlight as efficiently as when you were young, and your kidneys are less able to convert vitamin D to its active form. People with dark skin, which has less ability to produce vitamin D from the sun. People with conditions that make it difficult to absorb nutrients from food, such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease. People who have obesity, because their body fat binds to some vitamin D and prevents it from getting into the blood. People who have had gastric bypass surgery, a type of weight loss surgery which creates a bypass of part of the small intestine. Since vitamin D is absorbed there, bypassing part of it makes it harder to absorb enough vitamin D.  People with chronic kidney or liver disease, which can affect your ability to change vitamin D into a form your body can use. People who take medicines that affect vitamin D levels, including certain cholesterol, anti-seizure, steroid, and weight-loss medicines.   Talk with your provider if you are at risk for vitamin D deficiency.  There is a blood test that can measure how much vitamin D is in your body.  What problems does vitamin D deficiency cause?  Vitamin D deficiency can lead to a loss of bone density, which can contribute to osteoporosis and fractures (broken bones).  Severe vitamin D deficiency can also lead to other diseases:  In children, it can cause rickets. Rickets is a rare disease that causes the bones to become soft and bend. African American infants and children are at higher risk of getting rickets.  In adults, severe vitamin D deficiency leads to osteomalacia. Osteomalacia causes weak bones, bone pain, and muscle weakness.   How can I get more vitamin D?  There are a few foods that naturally have some vitamin D: Fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel Beef liver Cheese Mushrooms Egg yolks   You can also get vitamin D from fortified foods. You can check the food labels to find out whether a food has vitamin D. Foods that often have added vitamin D include: Milk Breakfast cereals Orange juice Other dairy products, such as yogurt Soy drinks   Vitamin D is in many multivitamins. There are also vitamin D supplements, both in pills and in a liquid for babies.  If you have vitamin D deficiency, the treatment is with supplements. Check with your provider about how much you need to take, how often you need to take it, and how long you need to take it.  Can too much vitamin D be harmful? Getting too much vitamin D (known as vitamin D toxicity) can be harmful. Signs of toxicity include nausea and vomiting, poor appetite, constipation, weakness, and weight loss.   Very high levels of vitamin D can damage the kidneys. It also raises the level of calcium in your blood. High levels of blood calcium (hypercalcemia) can cause confusion, kidney failure, and irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia).  Most cases of vitamin D toxicity happen when someone overuses vitamin D supplements. You cannot get too much vitamin D from sun exposure because the skin limits the amount of vitamin D it makes.",

Your liver makes cholesterol, and it is also in some foods, such as meat and dairy products. Your body needs some cholesterol to work properly. But having too much cholesterol in your blood raises your risk of coronary artery disease.  What is VLDL cholesterol? VLDL stands for very-low-density lipoprotein. Your liver makes VLDL and releases it into your bloodstream. The VLDL particles mainly carry triglycerides, another type of fat, to your tissues. VLDL is similar to LDL cholesterol, but LDL mainly carries cholesterol to your tissues instead of triglycerides.  VLDL and LDL are sometimes called \"bad\" cholesterols because they can contribute to the buildup of plaque in your arteries. This buildup is called atherosclerosis. The plaque that builds up is a sticky substance made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood. Over time, the plaque hardens and narrows your arteries. This limits the flow of oxygen-rich blood to your body. It can lead to coronary artery disease and other heart diseases.  How do I know what my VLDL level is? There isn't a way to directly measure your VLDL level. Instead, you will most likely get a blood test to measure your triglyceride level. The lab can use your triglyceride level to estimate what your VLDL level is. Your VLDL is about one-fifth of your triglyceride level. However, estimating your VLDL this way does not work if your triglyceride level is very high.   What should my VLDL level be? Your VLDL level should be less than 30 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). Anything higher than that puts you at risk of heart disease and stroke.  How can I lower my VLDL level? Because VLDL and triglycerides are linked, you can lower your VLDL level by lowering your triglyceride level. You may be able to lower your triglycerides with a combination of losing weight, changing your diet, and getting exercise. It is important to switch to healthy fats and cut back on sugar and alcohol. Some people may also need to take medicines.",

To make a diagnosis, your health care provider will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam. This will include checking your bones and muscles and doing a neurological exam. In some cases, you may have other tests, such as lab or imaging tests.  What are the treatments for walking problems? Treatment of walking problems depends on the cause. If the cause is a medical condition, treating that condition often improves your walking.

    "disease": "Weight Control",
    "summary": "Why is weight control important? If you are struggling with your weight, you are not alone. In the United States, more than 70 percent of adults are overweight or have obesity. Having this extra weight raises your risk for many health conditions, such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, and certain cancers.  Reaching and staying at a healthy weight can be challenging. But having a healthy lifestyle, including healthy eating patterns and regular physical activity, can help you lose weight. It can also lower your chance of developing weight-related health conditions.        What factors affect weight and health? You gain weight when you take in more calories (through food and drinks) than you use up from physical activity and daily living. But there are many different factors that can affect weight gain, such as:  The world around you. Your home, community, and workplace all may affect how you make daily lifestyle choices. For example: \t \t\tIt is often easier to find food and beverages high in calories, sugar, and fat. For instance, vending machines, cafeterias, and special events may not offer healthy, lower calorie options.  \t\tLess healthy foods may be cheaper than healthier foods.   \t\tMany people are getting less physical activity because they are spending more time using smartphones and other devices.  \t \t Families. Overweight and obesity tend to run in families. This suggests that genes may play a role in weight gain. Families may also share eating and lifestyle habits. For example, some families may often have foods and drinks that are high in calories, sugar, and fat. And some families may tend to be less active and spend more time doing things like sitting and watching TV or using computers. Not enough sleep. People who don't get enough sleep may eat more calories and snack more. Emotions. Some people eat when they feel bored, sad, or stressed, even if they are not hungry.  Medicines and health conditions. Taking certain medicines, such as steroids and certain antidepressants, can lead to weight gain. Some chronic health problems can also cause you to gain weight. A few examples are Cushing's syndrome and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS).   How can I get to and stay at a healthy weight? Getting to and staying at a healthy weight involves finding a balance of food and activity. To lose weight, you need to take in fewer calories than you use up. Some ways to do this are:  Eating more nutrient-rich foods, such as foods with lots of vitamins, minerals, and fiber.  Eating and drinking less of the foods and beverages that have lots of calories, salt, sugar, and fat.  Limiting alcohol.  Finding healthier ways to cook, such as using healthier oils to cook with and baking or grilling instead of frying foods.  Getting more physical activity. The general recommendation is for adults to get 150 minutes of physical activity each week. This time can be broken down into short bursts of activity throughout your day. Types of physical activity include:  \t \t\tAerobic activity, which is also called cardio. It uses your large muscle groups (chest, legs, and back) to speed up your heart rate and breathing.  \t\tMuscle-strengthening activity, which is also called strength training. It works your muscles by making you push or pull against something.  \t     You may decide to do these lifestyle changes on your own, or you may decide to try a weight-loss diet or program. Before you start, it's important to check with your health care provider first. Your provider can tell you what a healthy weight is for you, help you set goals, and give you tips on how to lose weight.   What are weight management medicines? If making lifestyle changes or doing a weight-loss program are not enough to help you lose weight, your provider may prescribe medicines. These medicines are meant to help people who have weight-related health conditions and should be used along with healthy eating and physical activity. The prescription medicines to treat overweight and obesity work in different ways. Some may help you feel less hungry or full sooner. Others may make it harder for your body to absorb fat from the foods you eat.  Another treatment is weight loss surgery. Your provider may recommend the surgery if you have severe obesity or serious obesity-related health problems and you have not been able to lose enough weight.  How can I maintain my weight loss? Maintaining weight loss can be challenging, and it's normal to slip back into old habits sometimes. The key is to keep a healthy balance of food and activity that works for you. Checking your weight regularly can help you notice small changes early and stay on track. And if you have a setback, don't be discouraged, simply refocus on your healthy habits and keep going.

Most people have no symptoms, while some may develop mild symptoms. But WNV can sometimes cause serious symptoms if the virus enters your brain.   How does West Nile Virus spread? WNV usually spreads to people through the bite of an infected mosquito. However, in rare cases, it can spread from person-to-person. This can happen through an organ transplant or blood transfusion. If you are preganant you can spread WNV to your fetus during pregnancy or delivery. And after delivery, it can spread to the baby during breastfeeding.  Who is more likely to develop West Nile Virus? Anyone could be bitten by an infected mosquito and get WNV. But certain people are at higher risk for more serious illness they get a WNV infection. They include people who:  Are over age 60 Have certain medical conditions, such as cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, or kidney disease Had an organ transplant   What are the symptoms of West Nile Virus? Symptoms can be mild to severe. But most people have no symptoms or mild symptoms.   Mild symptoms of WNV can include:  Fever Headache Body aches Vomiting Diarrhea Skin rash   These symptoms usually go away on their own within a few days to several weeks. But some people will have weakness or fatigue that lasts for weeks or months. Although rare, If West Nile virus enters your brain, it can be life-threatening. It may cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) or inflammation of the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (meningitis).   Serious symptoms of WNV can include:  High fever Headache Neck stiffness Numbness Coma Muscle weakness Vision loss   How is West Nile Virus diagnosed? To find out if you have WNV, your health care provider:  Will do a physical exam  Will take your medical history, including asking about your symptoms  May order blood tests   What are the treatments for West Nile Virus? There are no specific vaccines or treatments for human WNV disease. But rest, fluids, and over-the-counter pain medicines may relieve some symptoms. You may need to be hospitalized if you have serious symptoms.   Can West Nile Virus be prevented?  There are no vaccines or medicines to prevent WNV. The best way to avoid WNV is to help prevent mosquito bites:  Wear insect repellent with DEET or another U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-registered insect repellent. Make sure to follow the instructions for using the repellent. Wear long-sleeved shirts and pants if you're outside.  Get rid of mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flowerpots, buckets, or barrels. Stay indoors between dusk and dawn, when mosquitoes are most active. Use screens on windows to keep mosquitoes out.   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)",

    "disease": "Whooping Cough",
    "summary": "What is whooping cough? Whooping cough, or pertussis, is a respiratory infection that can cause coughing fits. In serious cases, the coughing can become violent and rapid. You may cough so hard that you vomit. The name of the disease comes from the whooping noise you might make when you try to breathe in after coughing.  Whooping cough is very contagious and can affect anyone. But it can be especially serious in babies who did not yet get the vaccine. About half of babies under age one who get whooping cough need care in the hospital.  What causes whooping cough? Whooping cough is caused by a type of bacteria called Bordetella pertussis. It spreads from person to person. People who have pertussis usually spread it through coughing, sneezing, or breathing very close to someone. It can also sometimes be spread by touching an infected surface and then touching your nose or mouth.  If you get pertussis, you are contagious for about 2 weeks after you start coughing. Antibiotics may shorten the time that you are contagious.  What are the symptoms of whooping cough? The symptoms of pertussis usually start within 5 to 10 days after you are exposed. But sometimes you may not get symptoms until up to 3 weeks later. Whooping cough usually starts with cold-like symptoms. They may last for 1 to 2 weeks and can include: Runny nose Mild fever Mild, occasional cough   The early symptoms in babies can be different. They may only cough a little bit, or they may not cough at all. Babies may have apnea, which means that there is a pause in breathing. They may start to turn blue. If this happens, get medical care for your baby right away.  As whopping cough gets worse, the symptoms may include: Fits of many, rapid coughs followed by a high-pitched \"whoop\" sound Vomiting during or after coughing fits Exhaustion after coughing fits   The coughing fits get worse and start happening more often, especially at night. You may have them for up to 10 weeks or more.  Recovery from this can happen slowly. Your cough gets milder and happens less often. The coughing fits can come back if you have another respiratory infection, even months after you first got whooping cough.  How is whooping cough diagnosed? Your health care provider may use many tools to diagnose whooping cough: A medical history, which includes asking about your symptoms A physical exam A lab test which involves taking a sample of mucus from the back of the throat through the nose. This may be done with a swab or syringe filled with saline. The sample is tested for the bacteria that causes whooping cough. Blood test Chest x-ray   What are the treatments for whooping cough? The treatment for whooping cough is usually antibiotics. Early treatment is very important. It may make your infection less serious and can also help prevent spreading the disease to others.  Treatment after you have been sick for 3 weeks or longer may not help. The bacteria are gone from your body by then, even though you usually still have symptoms. This is because the bacteria have already done damage to your body.  Whooping cough can sometimes be very serious and require treatment in the hospital.  Can whooping cough be prevented? Vaccines are the best way to prevent whooping cough. There are two vaccines in the United States that can help prevent whooping cough: DTaP and Tdap. These vaccines also provide protection against tetanus and diphtheria.    Babies and other people at high risk serious disease should be kept away from people who have whooping cough.  Sometimes health care providers give antibiotics to family members of people who have had whooping cough or people who have been exposed to it. The antibiotics may prevent them from getting the disease.  You may also help prevent the spread of whooping cough (and other respiratory diseases) by: Washing your hands often with soap and water. You can use an alcohol-based hand rub if soap and water are not available. Avoiding touching your face with unwashed hands Cleaning and disinfecting surfaces that you frequently touch, including toys Covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue or upper shirt sleeve, not hands Staying home when sick Avoiding close contact with people who are sick   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",

X-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation. They create images in shades of black, white, and gray because different tissues absorb radiation differently. Bones absorb the most radiation and appear white. Fat and other soft tissues absorb less and appear gray. Air absorbs the least radiation, so areas like the lungs appear black.  The image is recorded on film or sent to a computer. Health care providers use x-rays to find health problems and to check how well certain treatments are working.   Who needs an x-ray? X-rays are commonly used to check for fractures (broken bones). They are also used for other purposes. For example, chest x-rays can detect pneumonia. Mammograms use x-rays to look for breast cancer. X-rays are also used as part of other imaging tests, such as CT scans.   How do you prepare for an x-ray? In most cases, little or no preparation is needed. You may be asked to wear a lead apron to protect certain parts of your body. You may also be asked to remove jewelry or other items that could affect the image. The amount of radiation from an x-ray is small. For example, the radiation from a chest x-ray is about the same as the natural radiation you are exposed to from the environment over about 10 days. Always tell your provider if you are pregnant or think you may be pregnant.  How is an x-ray done? Depending on the part of your body being examined, you may be asked to stand, sit, or lie down. You will need to stay still for a short time while the image is taken.  What should you expect after an x-ray? After an x-ray, you can return to normal activities right away.

    "summary": "Zika is a virus that is spread mostly by mosquitoes. A pregnant mother can pass it to her baby during pregnancy or around the time of birth. It can spread through sexual contact. There have also been reports that the virus has spread through blood transfusions. There have been outbreaks of Zika virus in the United States, Africa, Southeast Asia, the Pacific Islands, parts of the Caribbean, and Central and South America.  Most people who get the virus do not get sick. One in five people do get symptoms, which can include a fever, rash, joint pain, and conjunctivitis (pink eye). Symptoms are usually mild, and start 2 to 7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito.  A blood test can tell whether you have the infection. There are no vaccines or medicines to treat it. Drinking lots of fluids, resting, and taking acetaminophen might help.  Zika can cause microcephaly (a serious birth defect of the brain) and other problems in babies whose mothers were infected while pregnant. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that pregnant women do not travel to areas where there is a Zika virus outbreak. If you do decide to travel, first talk to your doctor. You should also be careful to prevent mosquito bites:  Use insect repellent Wear clothes that cover your arms, legs, and feet Stay in places that have air conditioning or that use window and door screens    Centers for Disease Control and Prevention",
